Several organisms need food to maintain body temperature as well. A variety of substances are taken as food by every organisms from single celluar organisms like amoeba to the complex multicellular organisms like the human body. Even within the human body the cells require a wide variety of substances as food to carryout their functions. The mode of acquiring food varies from organism to organism.\n\nYou have studied in the previous classes about how different organisms get their food. Let us recall them.\n\nWhat are autotrophs? How do autotrophs get their food?\n\nWhat are heterotrophs? How do heterotrophs get their food?\n\nLet us study about autotrophic and heterotrophic modes of nutrition and find out why most plants are called as autotrophs.",

The process of photosynthesis is very complex. Several reactions takes place in this process and intermediate compounds are also formed. Scientists had tried to formulate a simple equation to indicate photosynthesis over 200 years. The equation that is used widely is formulated and proposed by C.B. Van Neil in 1931 . His opinion was,\n\n“for each molecule of carbohydrate formed, one molecule of water and one molecule of oxygen is produced”. Though photosynthesis is a very complex process, we use the following simple equation.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm {C O} _ {2} + 2 \\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} \\xrightarrow [ \\text {C h l o r o p h y l l} ]{\\text {L i g h t}} \\mathrm {C H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} + \\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} + \\mathrm {O} _ {2}\n$$\n\nWhat would be the reaction to show that glucose $\\mathrm { ( C _ { 6 } H _ { 1 2 } O _ { 6 } ) }$ is being synthesized? Write down a balanced equation to show this.\n\n(Refer the lessons Chemical equations, Carbon and its compounds in your textbook of physical science class X).\n\nVan Neil first worked on purple sulphur bacteria and found light plays a specific role in photosynthesis. Instead of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ they used $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { S }$ as a starting material. Here no oxygen is liberated during photosynthesis instead, elemental sulphur is evolved. Later he envisioned a similar process of photosynthesis in plants and proposed the above mentioned equation. Later Robert Hill showed that $\\mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ is released from water during this reaction. Then the equation was modified as follows.\n\n$$\n6 \\mathrm {C O} _ {2} + 1 2 \\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} \\xrightarrow [ \\text {C h l o r o p h y l l} ]{\\text {L i g h t}} \\mathrm {C} _ {6} \\mathrm {H} _ {1 2} \\mathrm {O} _ {6} + 6 \\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} + 6 \\mathrm {O} _ {2}\n$$\n\nIt is known that plants synthesize carbohydrates, the smaller simpler ones first and from them, the more complex ones like starch and cellulose. Plants are also capable of synthesizing all other compounds like proteins, fats etc.\n\nAnimals are not capable of synthesizing carbohydrates and they have to depend on plants for the same.\n\nCan we state that photosynthesis is the basic energy source for most of the living world? Why, why not?\n\nLet us study how the plants prepare carbohydrates through photosynthesis.",

    "text": "Let us discuss an experiment on photosynthesis. This one helps us to find out about the role of air in the process of photosynthesis. It is interesting to learn about the experiment which is one of the several milestones in the gradual development of our understanding of Photosynthesis.\n\nJoseph Priestly (1733-1804) in 1770 performed a series of experiments that revealed the essential role of air on the growth of green plants\n\n(photosynthesis was still not known to scientists at that time). You may recall, Oxygen was discovered by Priestly in 1774. The name oxygen was coined later by Lavoisier in the year 1775. Priestly observed that a candle burning in a closed bell jar, soon gets extinguished. Similarly, a mouse would soon suffocate in a closed space of the bell jar. He concluded that a burning candle or an animal, both somehow, damage air. When he placed a mint plant in the same bell jars, he found that the mouse stayed alive and the candle when lighted from outside continued burning in the presence of the mint plant. Priestly hypothesized as follows: ‘Plants restore the air what breathing animals and burning candles remove’.\n\n![](images/e5ec8aaf49de2e3fd7a5137ce67a1e965b63cdaace5bdce351056305c057788a.jpg)\n\n![](images/7d4ab83cf6c37f32454c5f68dd029108d8cfecd4c141026f9606b73e6a8388ec.jpg)\n\n![](images/9802def4ea9f9697216855819cca2658ca6a4239c0e0d4ff08edda9c890a0c5f.jpg)\n\n![](images/49330fc252409d9f7332356491c2b8e72410703c44b492a2491bfa598e84f3ba.jpg)  \nfig-3: Priestly experiment\n\nDo you find any relationship between candle, rat, mint plant ? Discuss.\n\nDo similar experiment in your school. Use a candle, plant in a small pot and a bell jar. Note down your observations and explain.\n\nPriestly’s experiment confirmed that gaseous exchange was going on and plants were giving out a gas that supported burning and was essential for the survival of animals.\n\nBut how do plants take in air and utilize carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and oxygen for respiration?\n\nHow do they make the choice?\n\nMassive amounts of gaseous exchange occur through the stomata (usually present in leaves) as long as they are open .While plants also carry on gaseous exchange through loose tissues in the stems, roots etc.\n\nIt is actually at the level of the organelles involved in the process of photosynthesis and respiration that the choice of the gas required is made.",

If energy is released when carbon dioxide and water is formed by combining oxygen with carbon and hydrogen, then what about the reverse?. What about forming oxygen again and putting it back in the air. Eventually, scientists learned that the energy situation would also reverse. Oxygen formation would use up energy. That means if plants\n\nform oxygen they have to get energy to make it possible. Where did the energy come from?\n\nA Dutch scientist, Jan Ingenhousz (1730-1799), found the answer. He studied the way in which plants form oxygen. In 1779, he noticed that it happened only in the presence of light. In an experiment with the aquatic plant, Hydrilla, he observed that in bright sunlight, small bubbles formed around the green parts while in the dark they did not form. He also found that the gas present in the bubbles was oxygen.\n\nIt was further confirmed when Engelman in the early $2 0 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century ingeniously detected the point of maximum rate of photosynthesis. He used a strand of algae and exposed it to different colours of light (the colours that we see in a rainbow) Then he used oxygen sensitive bacteria and found that they crowd around areas illuminated with red and blue rays of light. This led to more studies on effect of light on photosynthesis, the role of different coloured compounds called pigments in plants and the utilization of light energy.",

He proposed that only green plant parts could carry out the process of photosynthesis.\n\nWhat about plants having coloured leaves? How is it that new leaves which look dark red in colour in several plants turn green? Do plants having reddish or yellowish leaves also carry out photosynthesis? What made plants carry out photosynthesis while even green coloured animals (like some birds )could not? Questions like these remained challenges until scientists could isolate the green coloured substance from plant parts and study its nature.\n\nEstablishment of Ingenhousz’s proposition came after several experiments till the mid $2 0 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century when scientists could also locate the site of photosynthesis and even isolate it. Around four decades after Ingenhouszs’ proposition scientists could only isolate the green substance to observe its nature and find out whether photosynthesis could be carried out with it. This had become possible in the year 1817 due to the work of two scientists Pelletier and Caventou who obtained an extract of the green coloured substance and named it ‘chlorophyll’ meaning green leaf.\n\nIt was also found that pigments in addition to chlorophyll, carotenoids and phycobilins could also aid in the process of photosynthesis by passing on the energy of sunlight trapped by them to chlorophyll.",

The third layer forms stacked sack like structures called as grana. It is believed to be a site for trapping of solar energy. The intermediary fluid filled portion is called as stroma. It is believed to be responsible for enzymatic reactions leading to the synthesis of glucose, which in turn join together to form starch.\n\nSubstances found in chloroplast which capture sunlight are called photosynthetic pigments. There are several types of photosynthetic pigments involved in the process to produce organic molecules like glucose in plants.\n\nChlorophyll is such a pigment which contain one atom of magnesium. It is similar in structure to the haem of haemoglobin. (The iron containing red pigment that transports oxygen in blood.) Two major kinds of chlorophylls are associated with thylakoid membranes. Chlorophyll ‘a’ is blue-green in colour and chlorophyll ‘b’ is yellow-green colour. Around 250 to 400 pigment molecules are grouped as light harvesting complex or photosynthetic unit in each thylakoid. Such innumerable units function together in chloroplasts of green plants in the process of photosynthesis.\n\nDuring photosynthesis several events occur in the chloroplast some of them are:\n\n1. Conversion of light energy to chemical energy   \n2. Splitting of water molecule (photolysis of water)   \n3. Reduction of carbondioxide to carbohydrates\n\nLight is required to initiate several events while several may continue even in absence of it. That would mean, once light energy has been captured it can help reactions to continue even in the dark.

A series of chemical reactions occur in a very quick succession initiated by light and therefore the phase is technically called the photochemical phase or light dependent reaction. The light reaction takes place in chlorophyll containing thylakoids called grana of chloroplasts. Several steps occur in the light dependent reaction.\n\nStep-I : The chlorophyll on exposure to light energy becomes activated by absorbing photons. (Photon is the smallest unit of light energy)\n\nStep-II: The energy is used in splitting the water molecule into two component ions named hydrogen $\\mathrm { ( H ^ { + } ) }$ , hydroxyl ion (OH- ).\n\n$$\n\\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} \\quad \\mathrm {H} ^ {+} + \\mathrm {O H} ^ {-}\n$$\n\nThe reaction is known as photolysis, which means splitting by light (photo means light, lysis means breaking).

Hence it is also called Hill’s reaction.\n\nStep-III: The highly reactive $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ , OH-- ions of water undergo quick change as described below.\n\nOH- ions through a series of steps produce water $\\left( \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } 0 \\right)$ and Oxygen $( \\mathrm { O } _ { 2 } )$ .

Some organisms break down the food materials outside the body and then absorb it. For example, bread moulds, yeast, mushrooms etc. which are called saprophytes. Some other organisms derive nutrition from plants or animals without killing them. This type of parasitic nutritive strategy is used by a wide variety of organisms like Cuscuta, lice, leeches and tape worms. Others take in whole material and break it down inside their bodies. What can be taken in and broken down depends on the bodys’ design and it’s function.\n\nSince the food and the way it is obtained differs, the digestive system is also different in various organisms. In single celled organisms, like amoeba the food may be taken in by the entire surface but as the complexity of the organism increases, different parts become specialized to perform different functions.\n\n![](images/a733e960ed5ee87e5070016bb62fc4db4aa1069af94630d81ffbeb1e9f896c14.jpg)\n\n![](images/fc462a5241665fd9bb513e1591823c71247b824cb5a1a87a1ca8ea7389780edb.jpg)\n\nFor example amoeba [fig-9(a)] takes in food using temporary finger like extensions (pseudopodia) of the cell surface which fuse over the food particle forming food vacuole. Inside the food vacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones. Then diffuse into the cytoplasm. The remaining undigested material is moved to the surface of the cell and thrown out. In Paramoecium [fig-9(b)], which is also a unicellular organism the cell has a definite shape. Food is taken in at a specific spot. Food is moved to the spot by the movement of cilia which covers the entire surface of the cell, where the food is ingested (cytostome).",

Cuscuta reflexa\n\nhas been found to have very little amount of chlorophyll and instead absorbs food through haustoria. They are root like structures that penetrate the tissue of a host plant and may kill it. The slender, string like stems of the dodder may be yellow, orange, pink, or brown in colour. It’s leaves are reduced to minute scales. The dodder’s flowers, in nodule like clusters, are made up of tiny yellow or white bell-like petals.\n\nThe dodder’s seed germinates, forming an anchoring root, and then sends up a slender stem that grows in a spiral fashion until it reaches a host plant. It then twines around the stem of the host plant and forms haustoria, which penetrate through it. Water is drawn through the haustoria from the host plant’s xylem, and nutrients are drawn from its phloem. Meanwhile, the root rots away after contact has been made with a host stem. As the dodder grows, it sends out new haustoria (parasitic roots) and establishes itself very firmly on the host plant. After growing in a few spirals around one host shoot, the dodder finds its way to another, and it continues to twine and branch until it resembles a fine, densely tangled web of thin stems enveloping the host plant.

The lower jaw also helps in the whole process.\n\nWe can find out the effect of salivary amylase on carbohydrates to observe what might be happening in our mouth.\n\np To know the chemical nature of the saliva perform the activity-7 of co-ordination in life process of this text book.\n\nThe soft food mixed with saliva passes through oesophagus or food pipe by wave like movements called peristaltic movement to the stomach.\n\nAt the stomach, food gets churned with gastric juice and HCl. Now the food is in semisolid condition. The digestion of food goes on as most proteins are broken down into smaller molecules with the help of enzyme pepsin acting on them.\n\n![](images/158ad13f200f9cf56f302fb3a619c7507fbd2e8aafdd9b313a8d8241bb318f6f.jpg)  \nperistaltic wave\n\n![](images/6d48285458557aef4dc68a06f9a22849a3bc694ff45973183a60c0b5e98fc85f.jpg)  \noesophagus   \nfig-13: Peristaltic movement\n\nFood in the form of a soft slimy substance where some proteins and carbohydrates have already been broken down is called chyme. Now the food material passes from the stomach to the small intestine. Here the ring like muscles called pyloric sphincters relax to open the passage into the small intestine. The sphincters are responsible for regulating the opening of the passage such that only small quantities of the food material may be passed into the small intestine at a time.\n\nThe small intestine is the longest part of the alimentary canal. Its proximal part is called duodenum. It is the site of further digestion of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. It receives the secretion of liver and pancreas for this purpose. These juices render the internal condition of the intestine gradually to a basic or alkaline one.\n\nFats are digested by converting them into small globule like forms by the help of the bile juice secreted from liver. This process is called emulsification.\n\nPancreatic juice secreted from pancreas contains enzymes like trypsin for carrying on the process of digestion of proteins and lipase for fats.",

Internally, intestinal wall has a number of finger like projections called Microvilli. The villi increase the surface area for absorption. Blood vessels and lymph vessels are present in the form of a network in the villi.\n\nProducts of digestion are absorbed first into the villi and from here into the blood vessels and lymph vessels. Thus after maximum absorption of food in the small intestine the rest passes into the large intestine. Here most of the water present is taken up from this material. This material is then expelled through the anus which is the last part of the alimentary canal. This passage of undigested material from the body by the way of anus is called defecation. Food that passes out of the anus still contains considerable amount of proteins, fats and carbohydrates, roughages or fibres of either carbohydrates or proteins. We will learn some more points about the coordination about digestive system with other systems in the chapter coordination in life processes.",

    "text": "The human alimentary canal usually functions remarkably well considering how badly we treat it on occasions! Sometimes it rebels, and we either feel sick or have indigestion.\n\nVomiting is the body’s method of ridding itself of unwanted or harmful substances from the stomach. The peristaltic movements of the stomach and oesophagus reverse their normal direction and the food is expelled. There are many causes of vomiting, but one of the most common is over eating, especially when the food contains a high proportion of fat. Vomiting also occurs when we eat something very indigestible or poisonous.\n\nWhen we have a greenish vomit usually called as ‘bilious’ or ‘liverish’, we get a bitter taste and it is often the result of having over eaten. The liver is unable to cope with the excessive fat and we get a feeling of nausea.\n\nIndigestion is a general term used when there is difficulty in digesting food. Healthy people can usually avoid problems related to digestion by:\n\na) having simple, well balanced meals   \nb) eating food in a leisurely manner   \nc) thoroughly masticating the food   \nd) avoiding taking violent exercise soon after eating food   \ne) Drinking plenty of water and having regular bowel movements.\n\nA more serious form of indigestion is caused by stomach and duodenal ulcers. These conditions occur more often in people who may be described as hurried or worried. Thus, ulcers occur more often in busy people who get into the habit of hurrying over meals and rushing from one activity to another without sufficient rest. Those who are able to relax, who are not continually tensed up, and who live at a slower pace, seldom get ulcers. You studied about recent researches in the peptic ulcers caused by some bacteria in previous classes.\n\nProper functioning of all life processes require adequate amount of food in all living organisms. It is not just the intake of food but its assimilation and expulsion of wastes that play an important role. In take of fibre rich food avoids constipation.",

Some of them are suffering by consuming high calorific food. Most of them are facing various diseases due to lack of balanced diet. It is very important to discuss about food deficiency diseases.\n\nEating of food that does not have one or more than one nutrients in required amount is known as malnutrition. Poor health, will full starvation, lack of awareness of nutritional habits, socio-economic factors are all the reasons for malnutrition in our country.\n\nMalnutrition is of three types\n\n![](images/7710de08753a7ea84ca255e8df4026f96e76defd40ca9f7d768930e15b4e655d.jpg)\n\n![](images/cbdc132c8343b88da8ef4f037be70b8f917e1561101179648bb9be817207085b.jpg)  \nfig-14: Kwashiorkor\n\n![](images/e132e1c518dc6cbb57aca2fc975b5bf25b2137a26e21789c24dd9180e32fbad8.jpg)  \nfig-15: Marasmus   \nfig-16: Obesity\n\n![](images/e9f7b9b135eceb0c278cc17877c6c2f24da78a3ec7362c4094caceab4c09db1b.jpg)  \nfig-17: Pellagra\n\notein malnutrition,   \n2.

Body parts become swollen due to accumulation of water in the intercellular spaces. Very poor muscle development, swollen legs, fluffy face difficult to eat, diarrhoea, dry skin are the symptoms of this disease.   \n2. Marasmus: This is due to deficiency of both proteins and calories. Generally this disease occurs when there is an immediate second pregnancy or repeated child births. Lean and weak, less developed muscles, dry skin, diarrhoea, etc., are the symptoms of this disease.\n\nObesity: This is due to over eating and excess of clories in take. It is a big health hazard. Obese children when grow, they will be target of many diseases like diabetes, cardio vascular, renal, gall bladder problems. Discuss about junk foods and other food habits which leads to obesity.",

This process of breaking down of complex molecules into simple molecule is called digestion.\n\nIn human beings the food eaten is broken down in various steps with the help of enzymes secreted by digestive glands which are associated with the alimentary canal and the digested food is absorbed in small intestine to be sent to all cells in the body.\n\nThe digestive system includes the alimentary tract and several associated organs and digestive glands. The functions of system are as follows :\n\na) Ingestion: Taking of food into the body   \nb) Digestion: Breaking up of complex food substances into the simple substances by specific enzymes.

In the chapter, on nutrition we have discussed how the body draws out nutrients from the food taken in. The food provides energy for all the biological activities only after break down through the process known as respiration. Thus, respiration leads to final utilization of food. Normally respiration takes place in oxygen rich enveronment. Cells of the living body use food constantly to help our body to function properly. They require the presence of gas, food material and some chemicals.\n\nThe term ‘respiration’ derived from Latin word ‘respire’ meaning ‘to breathe’, refers to the whole chain of processes from the inhalation of air to the use of oxygen in the cells.

    "text": "The term respiration came into use, a century after the word breathing was used, way back in the $1 4 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century. It was used much before people knew that air is a mixture of gases. They hardly knew anything about all the life processes that took place internally in a living body. Respiration which was used as a medical term, usually referred to as a process involving passage of air and production of body heat.\n\nIt was not until $1 8 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century when Lavoisier and Priestley did a comprehensive work on properties of gases, their exchange and respiration that we came to know something about how the process of gaseous exchange goes on, in our body. You have already studied about\n\n![](images/1e1daad3be4bbbbb7fb51a79a89dd40c01c1a6e7e3ad17639f01a9b1e178b9ab.jpg)  \nfig-1: Lavoisier\n\nsome of Priestley’s experiments in earlier classes (You have an account of it in the chapter on nutrition as well). Recall the concepts and answer the following.\n\nCan it be said that Priestley’s experiment helped us to find out more about composition of air? How?\n\nLavoisier also carried out several experiments to understand the property of gases. In his early experiments, it is clear that Lavoisier thought that the gas liberated on heating powdered charcoal in a belljar kept over water in a trough was like fixed air. In those days carbon dioxide was known as fixed air. The next series of experiments dealt with the combustion of phosphorus in a belljar. From these studies Lavoisier showed that whatever in the atmospheric air which combined with the phosphorus, was not water vapour. His final words are that the substance which combines with the phosphorus is “either air itself, or another elastic fluid present, in a certain proportion, in the air which we breathe”. This was the respirable air, a component of air that also helped in burning.\n\nWhat was produced by combustion according to Lavoisier?\n\nWhat did Lavoisier find out about air from his experiments?\n\nWhat conclusion can be drawn from Lavoisier’s experiments?\n\nLavoisier noted that there was a profound difference between the air in which combustion of a metal had been carried out and the one which had served for respiration. The air that we breathe out precipitated lime water while that after heating metal did not.\n\nFrom this he deduced that there were two processes involved in respiration, and that of these he probably knew only one. Therefore, he carried out another experiment by which he showed that about one sixth of the volume of ‘vitiated air’(a term used then to show air from which the component needed for burning had been removed) consists of chalky acid gas (fixed air). Therefore, to recreate common air from vitiated air, it was not enough merely to add the appropriate amount of air needed for burning or respirable air; the existing chalky acid gas must also be removed.",

    "text": "He drew immediately the logical conclusion regarding the process of respiration. Either eminently respirable air is changed in the lungs to chalky acid air; or an exchange takes place, the eminently respirable air being absorbed, and an almost equal volume of chalky acid air being given up to the air from the lungs. He had to admit that there were strong grounds for believing that eminently respirable air did combine with the blood to produce the red colour. (But in due course the scientists identified that due to haemoglobin the blood is red in colour.)\n\n![](images/b10e25ee606b47f4fd6cbcd687a8feaca24883fe411e7e43320d1438e58e6a4c.jpg)  \nfig-2: Priestley\n\nLavoisier’s findings lead way to several other researchers.\n\nWhich gas do you think is Lavoisier talking about when he says chalky acid gas?\n\nWhich gas according to him is respirable air?\n\nWhat steps in the process of respiration does Lavoisier mention asN an inference of his experiments?\n\nA few lines from a textbook of Human Physiology, written by a renowned chemist, John Daper around mid-19th century goes like this..\n\n‘‘The chief materials which a living being receives are matter that can be burnt, water and oxygen gas; and out of the action of theseG upon one another, all the physical phenomena of its life arise. What the body expels out is water, oxide of carbon, phosphorous, sulphur and others.’’\n\nThus, we can see that the role of major compounds and elements in the process of respiration was known by mid19thcentury. The eventsA involved were not very clearly understood, but, people believed that there was some relationship of the heat produced in the body and the process ofL respiration.\n\nIt is a common observation that our breath is warmer than the airE around us; does respiration have anything to do with this?\n\nLet us study the events involved in respiration in human beings to figureT it out.",

The organs involved are mainly the lungs. You can’t see your lungs, but it’s easy to feel them in action. Put your hands on your chest and breathe in very deeply. You will feel your chest getting slightly bigger. Now breathe out the air, and feel your chest return to its regular size. You’ve just felt the power of your lungs! The lungs themselves can neither draw in air nor push it out. Instead, the chest wall muscles and another flexible\n\nflattened muscle called diaphragm helps the lungs in moving air into and out of them. See how the diaphragm works in the figure.\n\nWhat is the role of diaphragm and ribs in respiration? Are both active in men and women?\n\nThe chest wall is made up of ribs, muscles, and the skin. The ribs are attached at an angle to the spine (if you run your finger along one of your ribs, you will notice that it extends downward from the spine). When we inhale, the chest wall moves up and expands. This causes an increase in the volume of the chest cavity.\n\nThe diaphragm may be imagined as the ‘floor’ if you think of the chest cavity as a “room.” When the diaphragm is relaxed when we breath out, it is in the shape of a dome with the convex side of the dome extending into the chest cavity. When the diaphragm contracts during inhalation it flattens out a bit or the dome moves downward. As a result, the volume of the chest cavity is increased.\n\nWhen the diaphragm flattens and the volume of the chest cavity is increased, its internal pressure decreases and the air from the outside rushes into the lungs. This is inspiration (inhalation).\n\nThen the reverse occurs. The chest wall is lowered and moves inward, and the diaphragm relaxes and assumes its dome shape. These changes increase the pressure on the lungs; their elastic tissue contracts and squeezes the air out through the nose to the external atmosphere. This is expiration (exhalation).\n\n![](images/77f331616297c52f913d71f014f15c0eaec91d0db20018d3a1886bd6a2ee4430.jpg)",

    "text": "The term cellular respiration refers to the pathway by which cells release energy by breaking the chemical bonds of glucose molecules. Thus cellular respiration is the essential processes of life. So living cells must carry out cellular respiration. It can be in the presence of oxygen that is ‘aerobic respiration’, or in the absence of oxygen as in bacterial respiration by anaerobic method which is called fermentation. The substances become sour because of ethyl alchohol or lactic acid is produced in this process. In Animals the anaerobic respiration leads to formation of lactic acid from glucose. In anaerobic repiration few ATP molecules are produced. Cellular respiration in prokaryotic cells like that of bacteria occurs within the cytoplasm. In eukaryotic cells cytoplasm and mitochondria are the sites of the reactions. The produced energy is stored in mitochondria in the form of ATP. That is why mitochondria are called “power houses of the cell”.\n\nThe exact chemical details of the breakdown of sugar or other foods within a living cell does not take place as a single reaction, but occurs in a series of small steps.\n\nHow does this affect the energy release? As the change in the chemical nature of the molecule from one stage to the next is slight, in any step small amount of energy is released. The complete breakdown of a sugar molecule with the release of all its available energy\n\n![](images/381424cc984cd819483155e8f9b50be016a5834f0ddd05d5b66247d4328f52f6.jpg)  \nfig-10: Mitochondria\n\ninvolves a series of different chemical reactions.\n\nFrom the breakdown of glucose the energy is released and stored up in a special compound, known as ATP (adenosine triphosphate). It is a small parcel of chemical energy. The energy currency of these cells is ATP an energy rich compound that is capable of supplying energy wherever needed within the cell. Each ATP molecule gives 7200 calories of energy. This energy is stored in the form of phosphate bonds. If the bond is broken the stored energy is released.\n\nDo cells of alveoli or lungs also require oxygen to carry out cellular respiration? Why/Why not?\n\nIn short, at cellular level we could have the following pathways starting with glucose (It is one example, remember that there are other components of food as well).\n\n![](images/ce2927eb97cd0e22f3f500d3d87b24833cbc686ef145a9635518afcb8f2adee4.jpg)\n\nGlucose is the most commonly used sugar for deriving energy in plants, animals and in microorganisms. In all these organisms the glucose is oxidized in two stages. In the first stage it is converted into two molecules of pyruvic acid. In the second stage if oxygen is available pyruvic acid is oxidized to $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ , water and large amount of energy is released.\n\nIf oxygen is inadequate or not utilised pyruvic acid is converted into either ethanol or lactic acid and very little amount of energy (nearly one tenth of that is produced with adequate amount of oxygen) is released.",

    "text": "After undergoing strenous exercise, we feel pain in muscles. Does adequate oxygen reach the muscles?\n\nWhat is being formed in the muscles?\n\nWhen you sprint a hundred yards, you do a considerable amount of muscular work. But you do not start a race by standing on the track and panting for a few minutes to stoke up with oxygen first. In fact you can run the race with very little extra breathing. The fastest sprinters do not breathe at all when running a hundred yards. After you have reached the destiny, however, you feel very different. Depending on your state of training, and on how hard you ran, you will pant for some minutes after the race, until your breathing gradually returns to normal.\n\nThese facts could be linked up with what we have learned so far about ATP. It might be that the race was run on the energy\n\nproduced when the ATP already present in your muscles was being converted to ADP. Unfortunately this pleasantly simple idea is inadequate, because we only carry sufficient ATP in a muscle to last for about half a second when doing vigorous exercise. There must be some other explanation for the way in which we can produce energy first and then use up oxygen later.\n\nOne approach in the study of this problem was to analyze the blood of a person during and after exercise. For obvious reasons the athlete taking part in the experiment had to stay still where the apparatus was. He pedaled a stationary bicycle, or ran on a tread mill (belt moving as fast backwards as the athlete moved forwards). Some results are shown in the graph. Vigorous exercise lasted for nine minutes (shown by the bar at the base of the diagram) and regular blood samples were taken and analyzed. One\n\nparticular compound in the blood, lactic acid, was found to vary greatly in its concentration as you can see from the graph.\n\nObserve the graph of lactic acid accumulation in the muscles of an athelete and answer the following questions.\n\n(Graph showing varying amount of lactic acid in the muscles)\n\nx - axis $=$ Time in minutes\n\ny - axis $=$ Concentration of lactic acid in blood $\\mathrm { m g } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$\n\n![](images/33cf1e9377080397e3dbc8d68ddb51d7d1062476119bdd4021a4f86fbaa32207.jpg)  \nfig-11: Athlete (Strenous excercise)\n\n![](images/9b978c578ba1e30457ac2eec1b3735f5c736358d2bc3d0b3610cb4af9784f8a4.jpg)  \nGraph showing effects of vigorous excercise on the concentration of lactic acid in blood.\n\na. What was the concentration of lactic acid in the blood to start with?   \nb. What was the greatest concentration reached during the experiment?   \nc. If the trend between points C and D were to continue at the same rate, how long might it take for the original lactic acid level to be reached again?

    "text": "Accumulation of lactic acid results in muscular pain. If we take walk, brisk walk, slow jogging, running for same distance we feel that there an increase in pain levels this is because of lactic acid accumulation.\n\nIt seems as if the lactic acid was being produced rapidly by the active muscles, and then only gradually removed from the blood after exercise. What is surprising is that the athlete needs a great length of time to recover. The simplest explanation we can produce at-this stage is that the sugar in the working muscles was being changed to lactic acid. The energy stored in lactic acid molecules is less than that in sugar molecules, and if the acid comes from the sugar then the energy released could be used to rebuild ATP from ADP and phosphate.\n\nDuring a 100 m race a well-trained athlete can hold his breath all the time it is not until afterwards that he pants. In this case, the muscles are using the energy released during the anaerobic breakdown of glucose. It is not until afterwards that the athlete obtains the oxygen needed in order to remove the lactic acid. Therefore, when we under-take strenuous exercise we build up what is called an oxygen debt which has to be repaid later. In a longer race athletes have to breathe all the time, so some lactic acid isT removed while they are running, and they can go on for longer before becoming exhausted. The presence of lactic acid in the blood is the mainR cause of muscle fatigue, but if the body is rested for long enough the tiredness goes.",

You can remove dissolved oxygen from glucose solution by heating it for a minute, and then cooling it without shaking. Now put in some yeast; the supply of oxygen from the air can be cut off by pouring one centimetre layer of liquid paraffin on to the mixture.\n\n![](images/1d8e0cda5a9dd7f80917ebaa99ef0bcc810f5704d6ba5f7188c495876a358bfb.jpg)  \nfig-12: Testing for production of heat and $C O _ { 2 }$ under anaerobic respiration\n\n2. If you wish to check that the oxygen has been removed from the mixture, add a few drops of diazine green (Janus Green B) solution to the yeast suspension before you pour the liquid paraffin (wax) over it. This blue dye turns pink when oxygen is in short supply around it.   \n3. Arrange for any gas produced by the yeast to escape through a wash bottle containing bicarbonate/indicator solution (or lime water).\n\nDuring the process of anaerobic respiration some amount of carbondioxide is released. The released carbondioxide passes through the tube and turns lime water milky. We can observe the change in the temperature also during this process out for yourself. You may prefer to carry out the ‘carbon dioxide production’ part of the experiment on a smaller scale, using test tubes. If you do, then warm them to about $3 7 \\mathrm { { } ^ { \\circ } C }$ in order to speed up the test.\n\nWhat happens when a baker prepares a dough by mixing yeast in it?",

We know that we feel hot after some form of strenuous exercise such as running.\n\nDuring cellular respiration energy is released. Some part of energy is stored in the form of ATP. Some part of energy is utilised in our day to day life activities. And the excess amount of energy is released in the form of heat. But in case of vigorous activity like running we need more amount of energy. For this the rate of respiration is increased. So heat is also released in excess quantity. That’s why we feel warm. If the oxygen is not sufficient during vigorous exersise muscles start anaerobic respiration. Hence, lactic acid is formed. We know that accumulation of lactic acid causes pain in muscle. We reach normal position after some rest. Deep breathing helps us to restore energy in our body. Refer in annexure about Yoga Asanas.",

Single celled organisms Amoeba or multicellular organisms like Hydra and Planarians roundworms and earthworms obtain oxygen and expel carbon dioxide directly from the body by the process of diffusion. In other multicellular animals special organs are evolved. Animals either terrestrial or aquatic adopted to different types of respiration and possess different types of respiratory organs mostly depending on the habitat in which they live. Body size, availability of water and the type of\n\ntheir circulatory system are some of the reasons for the animals to develop different types of respiratory organs.\n\nThere is tracheal respiratory system in insects like cockroach, grasshopper etc. Tracheal respiratory system consists of series of tubes called trachea. This is divided into fine branches called tracheoles which carry air directly to the cells in the tissues.\n\nSome aquatic animals like fishes have developed special organs for respiration which are known as gills or branchiae. Blood supplied to gills through capillaries which have thin walls where gases are exchanged. This is called branchial respiration. Fish keeps its mouth open and lowers the floor of the oral cavity. As a result water from outside will be drawn into the oral cavity. Now the mouth is closed and the floor of the oral cavity is raised. Water is pushed into the pharynx and is forced to gill pouches through internal branchial apertures. Gill lamellae are bathed with water and gaseous exchange takes place.\n\nRespiration through skin is called cutaneous respiration. Frog an amphibian can respire through cutaneous and pulmonary respiration (through lungs) processes as well as Bucco-Pharyngeal Cavity. Terrestrial animals like reptiles, birds and mammals, respire through lungs. Ask your teacher how crocodiles and dolphins respire?\n\n![](images/34dd13e091fc9fc37fb351301d301c9f4487bf12fe5ae9a7cd84bc0be15d28f6.jpg)  \nfig-14: Leaf as a respiratory organ\n\n![](images/91de427cc9ce3d27029ee742594e625f04c47557097abcfc68ec81f386b518ab.jpg)  \nfig-15: Lenticels on stem",

It is the process of breakdown of complex food molecules or a catabolic process to produce chemical or potential energy.\n\nThis can be summarized by the equation\n\n$$\n\\left(\\mathrm {C H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O}\\right) \\mathrm {n} + \\mathrm {O} _ {2} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm {C O} _ {2} + \\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} + \\text {E n e r g y}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\mathrm {C} _ {6} \\mathrm {H} _ {1 2} \\mathrm {O} _ {6} + 6 \\mathrm {O} _ {2} \\longrightarrow 6 \\mathrm {C O} _ {2} + 6 \\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} + \\text {E n e r g y}\n$$\n\nPhotosynthesis and respiration appear to be opposing reactions, but both have very different biochemical pathways and are essential for a plant’s metabolism.\n\nPhotosynthesis takes place in the chloroplast to produce sugars, starch and other carbohydrates for the plant’s metabolic needs. Cellular respiration occurs in mitochondria where these carbohydrates are “burned” to produce chemical energy to function at the cellular level. During day time, the rate of photosynthesis is usually higher than that of respiration while at night it is just reverse in most plants. Temperature, humidity, light intensity etc. seem to affect the ratio of photosynthesis and respiration in plants.",

    "text": "By “respiratory system” we usually mean the passages that transport air to the lungs and to the microscopic air sacs in them, called alveoli (where gases are exchanged) and vice versa.\n\nThe term ‘respiration’ refers to the whole chain of processes from the inhalation of air to the use of oxygen in the cells.\n\nLavoisier found that the air that we breathe out precipitated lime water\n\nAir passes from nostrils to nasal cavity to pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi, bronchioles to alveoli and blood and back through the same route.\n\nGas exchange in the lungs takes place in the tiny air sacs called alveoli in the lungs. The lungs have millions of alveoli and each lies in contact with capillaries.\n\nDiaphragm is a muscular tissue present at the floor of the chest cavity.\n\nDuring inspiration (inhalation) the volume of the chest cavity is increased as the diaphragm contracts and dome flattens out, its internal pressure decreases and the air from the outside rushes into the lungs.\n\nDuring expiration, the chest wall is lowered and moves inward, and the diaphragm relaxes and assumes its dome shape. These changes increase the pressure on the lungs; their elastic tissue contracts and squeezes the air out through the nose to the external atmosphere.\n\nAir is filtered in the nasal cavity and the whole length of the trachea.\n\nThe moist surface of the lining of the nasal cavity, and the hairs growing from its sides, remove some of the tiny particles of dirt in the air. In addition, as the inhaled air passes through the nasal cavity, its temperature is brought close to that of the body, and it takes up water vapour. So that it becomes more moist than before.\n\nPharynx is a common passage of digestive and respiratory system. Epiglottis, a flap like muscular valve controls movement of air and food towards their respective passages.\n\nLarynx is a stiff box like structure containing our vocal cords. When air passes out of the lungs and over the vocal cords, it causes them to vibrate. This produces sounds on the basis of our speech, song etc.\n\nTrachea is the wind pipe channeling air to lungs.\n\nAt its lower end the trachea or the wind pipe divides into two bronchi-one leading to each lung.\n\nThe bronchi divide into smaller and smaller branches called bronchioles.\n\nThese finally terminate in clusters of air sacs called alveolus in the lungs which are very small and numerous. Gaseous exchange takes place here as blood capillaries take up oxygen and expel carbon dioxide here.\n\nAerobic respiration occurs in adequate supply of air producing a lot of energy, carbon dioxide and water.\n\nAnaerobic respiration and fermentation occurs in inadequate supply or absence of oxygen to produce energy.\n\nCells may resort to the breakdown of 3 carbon compound, pyruvate, aerobically or anaerobically depending upon the availability of oxygen. Usually in multicellular organisms cells fail to carry on the process of anaerobic respiration for long.\n\nRespiration is not essentially a process of combustion differ due to following reasons",

Where as our lung capacity is approximately $5 8 0 0 \\mathrm { m l }$ . So most of the time breathing takes place in the upper lobes only. This means we are not using our lungs to their fullest capacity. Even after complete expiration approximately 1200ml of air remains in our lungs. So we can make use of $4 6 0 0 \\mathrm { m l }$ of lung capacity for breathing. Think what changes are required to inhale that much air.\n\n![](images/b653ba5520925ec13f4601af148bb94eb06410b02c3d731bd88944788051742a.jpg)\n\nThe Indian ayurvedic physician. Patanjali developed a scientific breathing practice called Yogabhyasa. Maharshi Patanjali proposed a theory called Astanga yoga. He was introduced 195 yogic principles in eight divisions. 1. Yama (Social disipline), 2. Niyama (Individual discipline), 3. Asana (Body posture), 4. Pranayama (Expansion of vital energy), 5. Prathyahara (With drawal of senses), 6. Dharana (Consentration), 7. Dhyana (Meditation), 8. Samadi (Self realisation).\n\nThe art of breathing in Yogabyasa is called Pranayama prana means gas, ayama means journey. In Pranayama practice air is allowed to enterT three lobes of lungs inorder to increase the amount of oxygen to diffuse into blood. Deep breaths in Pranayama helps us to reduce breathings perR minute form 20-22 to 15. Because of these deep breaths more amount of oxygen available to brain and tissues of the body will be more active. It is very important to practice Pranayama regularly to make our life healthy and active. All people irrespective of age and sex should practice Pranayama under the guidance of well trained Yoga Teacher to improve the workingC capacity of lungs.",

    "text": "Let us study how we came to know about the structure and functions of the blood vessels.\n\nIt was not until $1 6 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century that we really came to know how our blood vessels functioned. In 1574, an Italian doctor, Girolamo Fabrici, was studying the veins in the leg. He noticed that they had small valves in them. If the blood moved in one direction, the valves folded towards the walls of the vessel, so that the blood could pass without trouble. If the blood moved in the opposite direction, the valves closed.\n\nThis meant they are one-way valves. The valves permitted the blood to move even when a person is standing upright. But not move downward.\n\nWhen a person moves his legs, or just tightens his leg muscles, those muscles squeeze the veins and force the blood in those veins to move upward against the pull of gravity (because that’s the only way to go). If a person keeps his leg muscles relaxed, the blood isn’t moving much, but at least it isn’t being pulled down by gravity. The valves won’t allow that.\n\nEveryone thought that the blood leaving the left ventricle always movedT away from the heart for which Fabrici paid no attention. He missed the importance of his own discovery. But then, William Harvey (1578-1657), an Englishman who, after he became a doctor, went to Italy for further education and studied under Fabrici.\n\n![](images/4cf174cb9ec54cb7b4612390dbf90cc19eb3d2aa64107e9a944bda5f8643fd97.jpg)  \nfig-6: William Harvey\n\nHarvey dissected the hearts of dead people and studied the valves between each atrium and its ventricle. He noticed that they were oneway valves. They allowed the blood to flow from the atrium to the ventricle without any hinderance.\n\nWhen the heart contracted, however, no blood in the ventricle could flow back into the atrium. Instead, all the blood was pushed out into the arteries.\n\nHarvey began thinking about the valves his teacher, Fabrici, had discovered in the leg veins. They were one-way, and they forced the blood to move toward the heart.\n\nHe checked that by tying off and blocking different veins in animals he experimented on the veins always bulged on the side of the block away from the heart. As though the blood as trying to flow toward the heart and to accumulate just below the block because it simply couldn’t flow away from the heart. This was true of all veins.\n\nIn the arteries, the blood bulged on the heart side of any block he put in, as though it were trying to flow away from the heart and couldn’t move in the other direction.",

    "text": "Harvey now saw what was happening. The heart pushed blood into the arteries, and the blood returned by way of the veins. It did this for both ventricles. The blood had a double circulation. If one started from the right ventricle, it left by way of the arteries to the lungs, and returned by way of the veins to the left atrium is known as pulmonary circulation and from there into the left Ventricle.From the left ventricle, it left by way of the arteries to the rest of the body and returned (in a “greater circulation”) by way of the veins to the right atrium and from there into the right ventricle. It is known as systemic circulation. As the blood reaches the heart two times, once through pulmonary cycle and again through systemic cycle, it is called double circulation.\n\nHarvey also showed that it was impossible, suppose that the blood was used up in the body and that new blood was formed. He measured how much blood the heart pumped in one contraction and also counted the number of contractions.\n\nHe found that in one hour, the heart pumped out a quantity of blood that was three times the weight of a man. The body couldn’t use up blood and form new blood at such a rate. The same blood had to circulate and be used over and over again.T\n\nHarvey still had some problem. The smallest arteries and veins that could be seen had to be connected by vessels too small to see. Were they really there?\n\n![](images/c90626f78004139a93226dd56ea3c91008263cbaa8faacb90b36ba87b3e4c285.jpg)  \nfig-7: Marcello Malpighi\n\nIn the 1650s, scientists had learned to put lenses together in such a way that objects too small to see with the naked eye could be magnified andE made visible. Marcello Malpighi (1628-1694), with the microscope, he could see tiny blood vessels that were invisible with naked eye.\n\nIn 1661, four years after Harvey’s death, Malpighi studied the wings ofC bats. He could see blood vessels in their thin membranes and, under the microscope; he could see that the smallest arteries and veins were connected by very fine blood vessels.\n\nHe called these blood vessels “capillaries” from the Latin word for “hair”, because they were as thin as the finest of hairs.\n\nWith the discovery of capillaries, the idea of the circulation of the blood was complete, and it has been accepted ever since.\n\n![](images/6c07539d84bc472f5e6536f65420fa9ef3878b1f787d3ce3c35ad36e625fc1b7.jpg)  \nfig-8(a): Try like this\n\n![](images/278f40ac4fc100ec191e2950eacb146a02ea013c87b1f4a57302b7168e714878.jpg)  \nfig-8(b): Harvey’s demonstration\n\nNow, we know that blood circulates in the blood vessels.

    "text": "The human heart starts beating around $2 1 ^ { \\mathrm { s t } }$ day during the embryonic development (refer reproduction chapter). If it stops beating, it results in the death of a person.\n\nOne contraction and one relaxation of atria and ventricles is called one cardiac cycle.\n\n1. We start with the imagination that all the four chambers of the heart are in relaxed state (diastole).   \n2. Blood from venacava and pulmonary veins enters the right and left atria respectively.   \n3. Now the atria contract, forcing the blood to enter into the ventricles.   \n4. When the ventricles are filled with blood they start contracting and atria start relaxing. The aperture between the atria and ventricles is closed by valves. On ventricular contraction due to pressure the blood moves into the aorta and pulmonary artery. When the valves are closed forcibly, we can listen to the first sharp sound of the heart lub.   \n5. When the ventricles start relaxing the pressure in the ventricles is reduced. The blood which has entered the arteries tries to come back into the ventricles. The valves which are present in the blood vessels are closed to prevent backward flow of blood into the ventricles. Now we can listen to a dull sound of the heart dub. The atria are filled up with blood and are ready to pump the blood into the ventricles.\n\nThe sequential events in the heart which are cyclically repeated are called cardiac cycle. The cardiac cycle includes an active phase systole and a resting phase the diastole of atria and ventricles.\n\nThe time needed for atrial contraction (atrial systole) is 0.11- 0.14 seconds. The time needed for ventricular contraction (ventricular systole) is 0.27-0.35 seconds. The time needed for relaxation of both auricles and ventriculars i.e. joint diastole is about 0.4 seconds. The whole process is completed in approximately 0.8 seconds.\n\nHence, naturally the blood is pumped into the blood vessels at regular intervals. The tissues will not receive the blood continuously, but in the form of spurts. When we keep our finger at the wrist, where the artery is passing into the hand we feel the pressure of blood moving in it. This is the pulse. The rate of the pulse will be equal to the number of heart beats.\n\n![](images/92818df01ec7f72750a6ae46974b1c40c990ca319549171c2038032e4a61a026.jpg)  \n5. Relaxation of ventricles.

In elders it will be clear that the lower part of the legs will be swollen. This stage is called edema.\n\nWhy do our legs swell?\n\nAs blood flows through tissues and through blood capillaries some amount of fluids and certain solid materials are constantly flowing out of them at different junctions. Such materials are to be collected and sent back into blood circulation.\n\nWe know that blood circulates in the blood vessels, pushed by the heart. From the heart it flows into the arteries and finally into the capillaries. To supply nutrients to the cells (tissues), the liquid portion of the blood with nutrients flows out of the capillaries. This is called tissue fluid.\n\nThe tissue fluid which is present in the tissues should be transported into the blood vessels again. Some portion of the tissue fluid enters into the venules, which in turn form the veins, which carry blood to the heart. What about the remaining tissue fluid? To transport the tissue fluid in to the main blood stream, a separate system is present. That is called lymphatic system. In latin lymph means water.\n\nLymph is the vital link between blood and tissues by which essential substances pass from blood to cells and excretory products from cells to blood. The lymphatic system is a parallel system to venous system which collects tissue fluid from tissues and transports it to the venous system.\n\n![](images/1a08fbe962b69d275e99ee71e156a2645ca4e9b3aae7da723706d3f2845b0708.jpg)  \nfig-12: Lymphatic system\n\nBlood is a substance which contains solid and liquid particles. Lymph is the substance that contains blood without solid particles. Tissue fluid is lymph present in the tissues. The liquid portion after formation of blood clot is serum.\n\nThe muscles which are attached to the skeleton (skeletal muscles) act as pumps when they contract and help in pushing the lymph flowing in lymphatic vessels and the blood flowing in veins towards the heart.\n\nThe valves that are present in the lymphatic vessels and veins stop the reverse flow of blood. We shall read about this as the system of lymph circulation in detail in higher classes.",

    "text": "When the unicellular organisms separated themselves from the sea with the formation of the limiting membrane, the problem of transportation arose. The nature has found the solution, by creating a microscopic ocean which has its own currents.\n\nIn unicellular organisms like Amoeba the protoplasm shows natural movements. These movements are called Brownian movements, because of which the nutrients and oxygen are distributed throughout the protoplasm equally.\n\nThis simplest intracellular transportation system, present in unicellular animals has been retained in multicellular animals including humans. The protoplasm of any cell in our body is mobile and protoplasmic currents exist even in the nerve cells.\n\nThe multicellular animals have to develop more complicated system for transportation of materials.\n\nThe parazoans like sponges, use sea water for transportation. Since the natural water currents are not reliable, the sponges create their own currents by beating of flagella that are present in their body.\n\nThe cnidarians which are better evolved than sponges (e.g. Hydra and jelly fish) have developed blind sac like gastrovascular cavity, which has taken up the function of digestion and transportation of nutrients to each and every cell of the body.\n\nIn platyhelmenthes (e.g. Fasciola hepatica), the digestive system is highly branched and supplies digested food to all the cells directly. In these animals the excretory system collects wastes from each cell individually. In these organisms most of the body is occupied by digestive and excretory systems.\n\nIn animals belonging to Nemathelminthes (round worms), the pseudocoelom has taken up the function of collection and distribution of materials.\n\nThe Annelids, the first Eucoelomate animals have developed a pulsatile vessel, to move the fluid and the transporting medium is blood.\n\nThe Arthropods have developed a pulsatile organ to pump the blood, the heart. The blood instead of flowing in blood vessels floods the tissues, directly supplying the nutrients to the tissues. Oxygen is directly supplied to the tissues directly by the respiratory system.\n\nSuch type of transportation system which supplies nutrients to the tissues directly is called open type of circulatory system.eg. Arthropods, many molluscs and lower chordates.\n\nThe other type of transportation system where the blood takes the responsibility of delivering the materials, which flows in the blood vessels is called closed type of circulatory system. Such type of closed circulatory system is present in annelids echinoderms, cephalopod molluscs (e.g. Octopus) and all the higher chordates.",

Then there is a drop in the pressure as the ventricles refill with blood for the next beat.\n\nB.P. is always measured in the upper arm artery. B.P. varies throughout the body, so a standard place must be used so that a person’s blood pressure can be compared over a period of time.

Only because of this character animals survive when they meet severe injuries.\n\nWhen there is an injury blood clots in 3-6 minutes. How does the blood clot? What chemistry involved in blood coagulation. You know that when you cut yourself, the blood flows out of the wound for only a short time. Then the cut is filled with a reddish solid material. This solid is called a blood clot. If blood did not clot, anyone with even a slight wound bleeds profusely.\n\nWhen the blood flows out, the platelets release an enzyme called thrombokinase.\n\nThrombokinase acts on another substance present in the blood called pro-thrombin converting it into thrombin.\n\nThrombin acts on another substance called fibrinogen, that is present in dissolved state converting it into insoluble fibrin.\n\nThe blood cells entangle in the fibrin fibres forming the clot.\n\nThe fibrin fibres are attached to the edges of the wound and pull them together.\n\nThe yellowish straw coloured fluid portion after formation of the clot is serum.\n\nProthrombrin ThrombinThrombrokinaseR\n\nFibrinogenFibrinogen FibrinThrombin\n\nDiscuss with your teacher about vitamin K in relation to coagulationE of blood.\n\n![](images/d4245176a723a374ea6496663f85073fb0bf1f62f2d85fb2a105c55b7f9750ab.jpg)  \nfig-14(a): Blood in the blood vessel\n\n![](images/7beddb4c3643153ec4007078d64c9f284687a97607059f7e520b5467749e5d58.jpg)  \nfig-14(b): Clot formation\n\nNormally the blood that oozes from a wound clots in 3-6 minutes.

    "text": "To perform this activity, you need to germinate bajra or mustard seeds.\n\nExamine some mustard seedlings which have been grown on wet filter paper. Observe the mass of fine threads coming from the seed by hand lens. These are roots. They have fine microscopic structures called root hairs. These are root hairs through which water enters the plant. Gently squash a portion of the root hair between slide and cover slip in a drop of water and examine under a microscope. Note the thinness of the walls of root hairs. It is not completely understood how the water enters the root hairs and passes inwards from cell to cell until it gets into the xylem vessels,\n\nbut there is no doubt that osmosis plays an important role.(IX class plasmamembrane)\n\nEvery living cell acts as an osmotic system, the cytoplasm lining of the cell wall acts as the semipermeable membrane. Observe the following figure, notice how do roots penetrate into soil? You will find that the root hairs grow out into the spaces between the soil particles and that the hairs are surrounded by moisture.\n\n![](images/8457e28a2a6a9d3bfcd63084914d4c7be30ba31a8ef6c975d69173fe3617d300.jpg)  \nfig-16: L.S of root showing relationship of root hair and soil water\n\nNote: In fig-16 Arrow marks shows the direction of flow of water.\n\nThe soil water is an extremely dilute solution of salts. Soil water concentration is more dilute than that of the cell sap in the root hair; therefore water will pass into the vacuole of the root hair by osmosis. Recall the process of osmosis that you have learnt in the chapter “moving of substances through plasma membrane” in class IX. The entry of water dilutes the contents of the root hair vacuole so that it becomes more dilute than it’s neighbouring cell.\n\nSo, water passes into the neighbouring cell which in turn becomes diluted, finally water enters the xylem vessels. As there are vast number of root hairs and root cells involved, a pressure in the xylem vessels develops which forces the water upwards. This total pressure is known as root pressure. Root pressure is not the main cause of movement of water in xylem but it is certainly one of the factor. The other factors are also there. You will learn about those reasons in higher classes in detail.",

How does the water reach 180 metres high to the top of a tree like a eucalyptus?\n\nLet us recall the activity that you performed in lower classes. Why inner sides of cover become moist? Where do these water droplets or water vapour come from?\n\n![](images/1939a33ff96aa9b545d777c48d04a7bb660023f3f9b24c3b336f81e3e0520c8e.jpg)  \nfig-18: Transpiration\n\nWe know that this type of evaporation of water through leaves is called transpiration. Water evaporates through stomata of leaves and lenticels of stem.\n\nWhen the leaves transpire, there is a pulling effect on the continuous columns of water in the xylem vessels. The top ends of these vessels are surrounded by the leaf’s mesophyll cells which contain cell sap, so the water is continuous from the xylem vessels to the walls of the mesophyll cells from which it evaporates into the air spaces causing the pull. The water column does not break because of its continuous molecular attraction. This is a property of water you demonstrate every time you drink through a straw.\n\nNow we have a picture of the water-conducting system of a tree. Water is absorbed by osmosis from the soil by\n\nthe root hairs. This is passed into the xylem vessels which form a continuous system of tubes through root and stem into the leaves. Here the water evaporates and releases into the atmosphere. The evaporation creates the main pull of water above root pressure which gives a variable and minor push from below. This results in a continuous column of moving water, the ‘transpiration stream’.\n\nIs there any relation between transpiration and rain fall?\n\nThe amount of water passing through a plant is often considerable. For example, an oak tree can transpire as much as 900 liters of water per day. It follows therefore that areas of forest significantly affect the degree of saturation of the air above them, so that when air currents bring air which is already nearly saturated to a forest area, it becomes fully saturated and comes down as rain; this is why forest areas often have a higher rainfall than areas nearby.",

The following experiments provide evidence that food is transported in the phloem cells.\n\nPhloem sieve tubes are extremely small and theN analysis of their contents is not easy. Biologists studied about food transportation in plants with the help of aphids (greenfly). When you see aphids clustering round the young stems of plants as they feed on the plant juices. To obtain this juice an aphidG pierces the plant tissues with its long needle like organ “proboscis”. It can be shown when a feeding aphid is killed and the stem carefully sectioned, the proboscisN only penetrates upto a phloem sieve tube. This\n\nproboscis also provides a ready-made means of obtaining the juice for analysis! The experiment can be done in this way. An aphid is killed while in the act of feeding and the body is then carefully cut away, leaving the hollow proboscis still inserted into the phloem. It is found that because the contents of the phloem sieve tubes are under slight pressure the fluid slowly exudes from the cut end of the proboscis in the form of drops; these drops are then collected and analysed. The fluid is found to contain sugars and amino acids.T\n\nNot surprisingly, aphids absorb so much sugar from the phloem that they cannot assimilate all of it and it excretes out of the body as a sticky syrup called honey dew. Leaves which have been attacked by aphids oftenT feel sticky as a result of honey dew.\n\n![](images/1bd7678f48aef266f74b23347f8277cbdd5c156543f300ece1e6409017fac33d.jpg)  \nfig-20: Removing ring of bark (Ringing experiment)\n\nYou may notice that sometimes barks of the tree damaged more than a half, even then the tree is alive.

This is a fact of great economic importance because certain mammals scratching the bark of trees to get the food stored in the phloem, especially during hard winters when food is scarce. Voles (rat like rodents) do this to young saplings at ground level and rabbits can do much damage to older ones. Foresters find it economically worthwhile to enclose new plantations with wire netting to prevent rabbits from entering.\n\nForesters also encourage predators such as foxes, badgers, hawks and owls as they help to keep down the population of voles and rabbits. Grey squirrels too do great damage, particularly Casurina crop grown at beech and seashore, and for this reason, in some parts it is impossible to grow these trees as a crop. Observe barks of trees in your surroundings for evidence of bark having been gnawed off saplings and trees. Note the species of tree, the position of the damage, whether the damage is recent or old, and the size of tooth marks if these are visible.

The two rigid blood vessels are arteries which supplies blood to body parts and lungs.\n\nThe less rigid vessels are veins, which brings blood from body parts.\n\nHeart has four chambers, two upper atria and two lower ventricles.\n\nAtrium and ventricle of the same side are connected by atrio ventricular aperture.\n\nAtria are separated from each other by interatrial septum, ventricles by interventricular septum.\n\nThe atrioventricular apertures are guarded by valves. There are valves in the aorta and pulmonary artery also.\n\nThe right side of heart receives blood from body and sends to lungs.\n\nThe left side of the body receives blood from lungs and send it to body parts.\n\nThe arteries carry oxygenated blood except pulmonary artery. The veins carry deoxygenated blood except pulmonary veins.\n\nOne contraction and relaxation of heart is called cardiac cycle.\n\nIf the blood goes to heart only once before it reaches all the body parts. It is called single circulation.\n\nIf it goes twice it is called double circulation.\n\nVitamin K deficiency leads to delayed coagulation of blood.\n\nPlants absorb soil water through roots by the process of osmosis.\n\nWater travels through xylem vessels and food material travels through phloem tissues.\n\nThere is a relation between tranportation and transpiration in plants.\n\nBiologists studied about phloem tubes with the help of aphids.",

    "text": "There is another antigen of red blood cells which is present in $8 5 \\%$ of the people of Britain, this is known as the Rhesus factor, as it was first discovered in Rhesus monkeys. People who have this are said to be Rhesus positive $( \\mathbb { R } \\mathbf { h } + )$ . Those who do not have this factor are termed Rhesus negative (Rh-). Normally they do not carry an antibody to this factor in their plasma. However, if Rh+ blood is transfused into the blood of a Rh- person, against Rh-factors will be formed and these are capable of destroying $\\mathrm { R h + }$ red cells. Under certain circumstances this is a potential hazard for babies.\n\nIf a $\\mathrm { R h + }$ man marries a Rh- woman, some of the children are likely to be $\\mathrm { R h + }$ . At birth there is always some mixing of blood between the circulation of mother and baby and this may occasionally happen during pregnancy. So, if a child is $\\mathrm { R h + }$ some of its blood will leak into its mother’s circulation and cause antibodies to form in her blood. If the mother has more children, not all will necessarily be $\\mathrm { R h + }$ , but if they are, the amount of antibodies in her blood often increases with each pregnancy, and in some instances the antibodies in her blood may pass into the baby’s blood in sufficient quantities to produce very serious anaemia and even death. Fortunately these cases are not frequent, and when they do occur, the baby is given a complete transfusion soon after birth so that the baby’s blood is replaced by blood containing no antibodies to the rhesus factor. It is now possible for this transfusion to be carrried out before birth. Another recently developed technique is for the mother to be given an injection shortly after the birth of her first child which prevents the $\\mathrm { R h + }$ cells from stimulating the production of the harmful antibody.",

Each kidney is convex on the outer side and concave on theA inner side. The position of the right kidney is lower than the left kidney due to the presence of liver above.\n\nLet us recall the last question in your lab activity.

But the lower sphincter is under the control of brain. So urine can still be retained until this muscle is relaxed too. Control of urination is not possessed by very young children but is gradually learned.\n\nUrge for micturition occurs when urinary bladder is filled with 300 - $4 0 0 \\mathrm { m l }$ of urine. The stretched bladder stimulates nerve endings to develop the reflex.

You are aware that a variety of end products are formed during metabolism and these nitrogenous wastes are important. Plants does not have specific organs to excrete these wastes. Plants break down waste substances at much slower rate than in animals. Hence accumulation of waste is also much slower. Green plants in darkness and plants that do not possess chlorophyll produce carbon dioxide and water as respiratory waste products. Oxygen itself can be considered as a waste product generated during photosynthesis, that exits out side through stomata of leaves and lenticels of stem.\n\nHow do the plants manage or send out waste products from its body?\n\nPlants can get rid of excess water by a process like transpiration and guttation. Waste products may be stored in leaves, bark, and fruits. When these dead leaves, bark, and ripe fruits fall off from the tree then waste products in them are get rid off. Waste gets stored in the fruits in the form of solid bodies called Raphides. However several compounds are synthesized by the plants for their own use especially for defence. Many plants synthesize chemicals and store them in roots, leaves, seeds, etc., for protection against herbivores. Most of the chemicals are unpleasant to taste. Hence, herbivores usually do not prefer to eat such plants. Some of the chemicals are toxic and may even kill the animal that eats them.",

These chemicals seal the wound and help the plant to recover from an injury. Some of the plants release attractants for other organisms which will help the plants for pollination, seed dispersal or even in their nutrition. For example, plants\n\nhaving root nodules secrete chemicals to attract rhizobia into the surroundings of the roots and form a symbiotic relationship with the rhizobium. These compounds are called secondary metabolites.\n\nWhy plants shed their leaves and bark periodically?\n\nThe biochemical substances produced in plants are of two types, primary metabolites and secondary metabolites. The materials like carbohydrates, fats and proteins are primary metabolites. The materials which do not require for normal growth and development are secondary metabolites. e.g.: Alkaloids, Tannins, Resins, Gums, and Latex etc. Though plants produce these chemical for their own use. Man found the usage of these chemicals for own benefits. They are generally coloured and fragrant.",

Modern chewing gum originally made of natural latex from plants like chicle, sapota etc. Whenever pollen grains enter in our body they cause allergy due to the presence of nitrogenous substances. These allergens cause skin allergy and asthma. Ex: Parthenium.\n\nDo roots secrete?\n\n‘Brugman’ a botanist proved from his experiments that the roots not only absorb fluid from soil, but returns a portion of their peculiar secretions back into it. We can see such instances in plants like apple where a single apple crop for 4 or 5 years continuously in the same soil, that fail to produce fruits. It will not give proper yield even if you use lot of fertilizers.\n\nDo you think there is any relation between reduction in yielding and root secretions?\n\nWhy do we get peculiar smell when you shift the potted plants?",

Excretion is the removal of materials from a living being, while secretion is movement of material from one point to other point. So secretion is active while excretion is passive in nature. Humans excrete materials such as tears, urine, Carbon dioxide, and sweat while secretion on other hand, includes enzymes, hormones, and saliva. In plants too we find excretion through roots into its surroundings and falling off leaves and bark.

The numerous tiny filters ‘S’ present in organ ‘P’ clean the dirty blood goes into circulation through a vein ‘T’. The waste substance ‘Q’ and other waste salts and excess water form a yellowish liquid ‘U’ which goes from organ ‘P’ into a bag like structure ‘V’ through two tubes ‘W’.

In Hyderabad where there are kidney transplantation facilities minimum 25 patients per hospital are waiting for kidney donors. Daily 10 - 100 people met with accident in our State. Out of them some people get brain dead. If we collect organs from brain dead patients in time, we can save minimum 5 peoples’ life. But lack of awareness on organ donation those who are willing to donate organs and those who need organs do not get proper information even facilities are there. Medical personnels from government and private hospitals are not informing about brain dead Patients. If they inform in appropriate time it will be very useful to patients those who are waiting for organ donation. In Hyderabad, organ Transplantation facility is available only in two government hospitals (NIMS and Osmonia) and in more than 10 corporate hospitals. Other organs like cornea transplant organs like kidney, liver, heart, lungs, pancreas, skin, bone, intestines and eye (cornea) can transplanted from brain dead patients.The process of transplantation of organs from brain dead patients to another is called cadaver transplantation. If any person is willing to donate organs or in needy get organs. They must register their names in transplantation facility hospitals.\n\nCollect information about a voluntary organisation working on organ donation and make a report.\n\nThere is very less awareness among people about organ donation. Society needs much awareness in organ donation, so that we can save many lives who are in need of different organs from donars for their survival. Instead of living in their memories, let us give them a chance to live in others for one more life.\n\nWe can live even after death",

    "text": "Sharpening of a pencil, grasping a door knob, walking or running, driving, and a few physical actions, all involve well coordinated movements made with well balanced postures. In fact, whenever we move the three basic functions, such as movement, balance and coordination work together to perform purposeful motions of body parts. This is actually quite a feat, because moving is a complex process for the body.\n\nEven standing upright is a difficult challenge of balancing on just two feet with a narrow base. Yet, it is common for us not only to stand upright easily and apparently, effortlessly, but also while keeping our balance to perform many other functions.\n\nWhat other functions do you think needed in coordination and balance?\n\nAll our functions are carried out by an effort of several systems working together. For example, while movement, we hardly ever use just the skeletal system or muscular system alone, several other systems also have their own roles to play. Even within the muscular system, several muscles work in a sequence or at once.\n\nWhat triggers movement of the muscles?\n\nAll our body organs, tissues and cells work together systematically. All of them pick up signals of change from their surroundings and respond to them. This process triggers different functions in our body as well as by our body. For example, it is natural to move to a side of the road when we hear or see a car approaching.\n\nHow do we respond so fast according to situation?",

We start sweating when it is hot and humid.\n\nThe ability to react to particular stimulus in a particular situation must be of great importance in ensuring the survival of the organism.\n\nThere is a sequence of events that brings about responses.

Finally the response will detect and execute the appropriate action.\n\nLet us do the following activity to find more about response to stimuli.",

    "text": "The Greeks believed that all functions of the body were controlled by the brain since damage to that organ produced remarkable changes in behaviour. They had very little idea on how such control could be exercised Though Galen, a Greek physiologist (A.D. 129-200) made one notable observation. One of his patients, having suffered a blow on the neck when falling from his chariot, complained loss of feeling in the arm while still retaining normal muscular control of its moment. Galen concluded that nerves were of two kinds – those of sensation and those of action. According to him the blow in the neck had damaged the nerves of sensation but had not affected it’s action.\n\nWhy do you think Galen draw such a conclusion?\n\nThe functioning of nerves as integrating systems was little known till late $1 8 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century. Then, physiologists began to study the mechanism of nerve functioning and found how signals were transmitted by making the connection between recent work on electricity and the propositions on working of the nervous system made till then.\n\nNow we know more about how nerves from different sections of the brain and spinal cord control responses of different areas of the body. We also know the probable pathways that transmit information but we still know very little about the working mechanisms of the nerve cell.",

There are fine projections mainly of two types extending from the cell body of the nerve cell. The small projections are dendrites while a long one that extends to different parts of our body is called Axon. The axon is surrounded by a specialized insulatory sheath called myelin sheath.This sheath is interrupted at regular intervals called nodes of ranvier.The myelin sheath is made up of schwann cells and chiefly consists of fatty material. Axons not having the sheath are non-myelinated\n\nfibers. The covering also forms a partition between adjacent axons. The nerve cell body lies either in our brain or spinal cord or very close to the spinal cord in a region called dorsal or ventral root ganglion. In the brain or spinal cord, it is difficult to make out the difference between dendrites and axons on the basis of their length, often, the presence of the sheath helps us to find out but several axons here do not have the sheath.\n\nWe know that the nerve cell is the structural and functional unit of nervous system. Our nervous system consists of more than100 billion of them, which communicate with each other in a specific manner. Dendrites of one nerve cell connect to the other or to the axons of the other nerve cell through connections called as a ‘synapse’.\n\nSynapse is the functional region of contact between two neurons, where information from one neuron is transmitted or relayed to another neuron.\n\n![](images/b20ca6b766a60626592c3b22dfb9e4fa84141b9b14424d8f077f0b9a0b34213c.jpg)  \nfig-4: Synapse\n\nThough these are regions of minute gaps and essentially neurons do not have any protoplasmic connection between them yet information is passed from one nerve cell to the other through these gaps either in the form of chemical or electrical signals or both.

Clearly a nerve pathway was involved.\n\nDuring actions which are involuntary and have to be carried out in very short intervals of time, the pathway that nerves follow is a short one; it does not go up to the brain while voluntary pathways are usually longer passing through the brain.

Animals were shown to have the ability to respond to stimuli even when the brain was removed. ‘Leonardo da Vinci’ (1452-1519) and ‘Stephen Hales’ (1677-1771) both recorded the survival of frogs whose brain had been destroyed. The animal still produced muscular movements if its skin was pinched or pricked. Both observers further recorded that the animal died as soon as spinal cord was damaged by pushing a needle down it.\n\nSuch evidence suggested that the spinal cord was not simply a trunk road for instructions from the brain, but might be a control center in its own right.T\n\nAccording to you what would be the function of the spinal cord?\n\nAre all functions of our body under direct control of the brain and spinal cord?

A very evident observation is the reduction and expansion of the pupil of our eye.\n\nWhen we enter a dark room we cannot see anything immediately. Slowly we are able to see the things around us in the room. This is because of increase in diameter of pupil, which allows more light in. When we come out of the dark room into broad day light the diameter of the pupil decreases allowing less light to enter into the eyes. Both these functions occur under the influence of the autonomous nervous system.",

    "text": "Research in the past two decades has brought out an interesting fact. Other than central nervous system and peripheral nervous system, there is a system of neurons present in our digestive tract that can function even independently of either CNS or PNS. It has been nick named as a second brain and the system is called as enteric nervous system (ENS).\n\nYou know that medulla oblongata is the region that regulates heartbeat, breathing etc. the system that helps to bring about such activities of internal organs is called autonomous nervous system. Normally such involuntary activities take place by the coordinated efforts of the medulla oblongata and autonomous nervous system.\n\n![](images/7270f1cbe18040c2c337bd9195cb8afcc4f51a33a88f764961f29cd06b226c97.jpg)  \nfig-14: Autonomous nervous system\n\nNow let us see how the autonomous nervous system influences the life activities. Observe the fig-14 and record your observations.\n\nTo which organs of the body do the nerves go from the ganglions near the vertebral column?\n\nWhat are the organs that receives nerves starting from the brain? Which are the organs whose activities are influenced by the sympathetic system?\n\nWhich are the organs whose activities are influenced by the para sympathetic system?\n\nWhat do you understand about the functions of para sympathetic system?\n\nWhat do you understand about the functions of sympathetic system?\n\nGanglia near the vertebral column are connected to the spinal cord by nerves. The sympathetic system is formed by the chain of ganglia on either sides of the vertebral column and the associated nerves. The para sympathetic system is formed by the nerves arising from the ganglia of the brain and the posterior part of the spinal cord. These together constitute the autonomous nervous system. It is the part of the peripheral nervous system consisting of twelve pairs of cranial nerves and thirty one pairs of spinal nerves.\n\nSeveral functions in our body are controlled by nerves while many of them and others are controlled by other ways as well. You might have heard about people having diabetes and know that they have to take tablets or insulin injections when the level of sugar in their blood rises.Let’s find out what insulin is and how we came to know about it. This would also give us an idea of controls other than nerves in our body.",

    "text": "In 1868 Paul Langerhans, Professor of Pathology at the University of Freiburg in Germany, working on the structure of the pancreas, noted certain patches of cells quite different in appearance from the normal tissue cells of the organ and richly supplied with blood vessels. They are known Islets of Langerhans (Islets stands for islands), but their function remained unknown. Many others interested in the function of pancreas and found that its removal from the body of an experimental animal would lead to the development of diseases similar to a well-known human ailment ‘sugar diabetes’. This is a condition in which the amount of free sugar in the blood and in the urine is abnormally high. It’s a cause in man was unknown but evidence pointed to the pancreas as a possible role.\n\n![](images/d51a18743a4ff864387501a878dabf832cf273760e28e1f66fad6e8c9287313f.jpg)  \nfig-15: Pancreas\n\n![](images/0cbc0257882bdb78c9885dbda16fce01b2ddf4fc5b69dfc540962190f301b878.jpg)  \nfig-16: Paul Langerhans\n\nThe next stage was reached when it was found that tying up the pancreatic duct that emerged from the duodenum( a part of the small intestine) would cause the pancreas to degenerate but the Islets of Langerhans would remain normal. Moreover, an animal so treated would not develop diabetes. This was really a strong evidence that the level of blood sugar is linked with the islet cells. By 1912, workers were convinced that the islets produced a secretion which directly liberated into the blood. In Latin ‘insula’ means an island. The name insulin was coined for the secretion, even though it had not been isolated.\n\nTen years later in Toronto, Banting, Best, and Macleod finally succeeded in extracting insulin from degenerate animal pancrease whose ducts to the intestine had been tied. When given by intravenous injection to a dog with no pancreas, this substance kept it alive and healthy with a low level of blood sugar. Insulin is now produced in large quantities for the treatment of human sufferers from sugar diabetes, to whom it is administered by injection into the skin.\n\nInsulin thus is a chemical that acts as it reaches blood from the cells that produce it.",

    "text": "The evidence that events occurring in one part of the body could be affected and indeed controlled by substances circulating in the blood was now overwhelming. In 1905 the English physiologist Starling had coined the term hormone (Greek, hormao – to impel) for such secretions. The glands secreting hormones were termed ductless glands, since they have no tube or duct to carry away their products, which pass straight into the blood. In this way they differ from glands such as the liver and pancreas, whose secretions pass down ducts which are connected to other organs.\n\nThe human body contains many other ductless glands (endocrine glands).Glands do not produce their hormones at a steady rate. The adrenal gland, for example, normally has a low output.\n\n![](images/e462a4d09a31f451aa7c0ca29fa44ed5304295b1b6f4c2922ec746a52251183e.jpg)  \nfig-17: Cock fight\n\nWhat will you do if a dog is after you? What will be your first reaction? Have you ever observed any change in your body when you are afraid?\n\nNobody wants to fight with a dog. The first thing we do is running away from the place.\n\nTry to note the body language of humans / animals when they are fighting / scared.\n\nIf we observe our body, when we are afraid, the rate of heart beat increases; the breath rate will be\n\nfaster; blood pressure increases; the hair on the body becomes erect and we get goose bumps. The other things we might not observe are pupil dilation, skin becomes more sensitive, and rarely the bladder and the rectum may be emptied. We come to normal state only after we reach a safe spot.\n\nWe have already studied about nerve co-ordination, where nerves carry stimuli from sense organs to central nervous system and orders to effectors organs-the muscles. But, in the above situation the action of the nervous system is limited. All the changes in the body are carried out under the influence of a chemical called ‘Adrenalin’ hormone, released by Adrenal gland which is an endocrine gland. The various actions of the body are controlled by hormones and co-ordinated by nervous system. So in this type of conditions nervous system and endocrine system work together to bring about control and co-ordination.\n\nAsk your teacher why Adrenalin hormone is also called fight or flight hormone.\n\nThe whole system of ductless glands is called the endocrine system. Information about a few of the endocrine glands is given in the next page accompanying table.\n\nTry to make a list of functions that you think are controlled both by the nervous and the endocrine system.",

The amount of adrenalin hormone increases in the blood sharply in a frightening situation, getting anger or excited.\n\nHave ever observed the duration of anger?\n\nWhy does anger come down?\n\nWhat may happen if anger persists for a longer period?\n\nAnger is always short lived factor. You know that increased levels of adrenalin are responsible for anxiety. When the levels of adrenalin in the blood come down slowly we come to normal state. If the adrenalin levels persist for a longer period of time, regular metabolic activities are disturbed.\n\nIncrease in adrenalin levels leads to anger, decrease in adrenalin levels leads to normal position.\n\nWhat will happen if it is continued for longer periods of time?\n\nSimilarly the sugar levels in the blood rise than normal level, they are detected by the cells of pancreas, which respond by producing more insulin into the blood. If the sugar levels come back to normal level secretion of insulin is automatically reduced.\n\nTable-2: Endocrine glands   \n\n<table><tr><td>Name of the endocrine gland</td><td>Location</td><td>Hormone secreted</td><td>Response of body to hormone</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"9\">Pituitary</td><td rowspan=\"9\">Floor of brain</td><td>1.

Due to water pressure pulvini hold the leaf erect. Touch me not plant shows nastic movement by touch. This is called thigmonasty. When we touch the leaves, an electrical impulse is generated. This impulse acts on plant hormone. Because of this hormone water in the pulvini cells which are closer to the leaf vein migrate to other side of the cells.Then pulvini loss its firmness hence leaves become fold. After 20 to 30 minutes water comes back pulvini attains firmness and leaves become erect.\n\nYou might have observed the tendrils of plants growing towards a support. Can you imagine how is it happening? Would you think it is responding to a stimulus?\n\nBoth plants and animals react to various stimuli around them. But the method of responding to stimuli is not similar in plants and animals. Higher animals respond to stimuli because they have a nervous system and an endocrine system. Plants do not have a well-defined nervous or endocrine system. They do have some mechanism of control by means of some chemicals or hormones.\n\nPlants can sense the presence of stimuli like light, heat, water, touch, pressure, chemicals, gravity etc. The hormones present in the plants called phytohormones (phyto means plant) control responses towards the stimuli mentioned above. Phytohormones coordinate the activities of the plant usually by controlling one or the other aspect of the growth of the plant. So plant hormones are also called growth substances.

The characteristic bending of the seedling did not occur. When, light was permitted to penetrate the cylinder bending occurred normally. They stated that when seedlings are freely exposed to a lateral light some ‘influence’ is transmitted from upper to the lower part causing the material to bend.\n\nIn 1926, the Dutch plant physiologist F.W. Went succeeded in separating this ‘influence’ from the plant fig-20: Elong that produced it. Went cut off coleoptile tips from oat seedlings. He placed the tips on a slice of agar and left them for about an hour. He then cut the agar into small blocks and placed a block on one side each stump of the decapitated plants. They were kept in the dark during the entire experiment. Within one hour he observed a distinct bending away from the side on which the agar block was placed.\n\nAgar block that had not been in contact with coleoptile tip produced either no bending or only a slight bending toward the side on which the block had been placed.\n\nWent interpreted these experiments as showing that\n\n![](images/50f87c3a262b9fd0982b168d962ec3e7d7790961ba0e461cdd6de674049e69c8.jpg)  \nfig-19: Bending towards sun\n\n![](images/7d22bbdfa753636f3da874e949d7e71acb138937dc73c406e2fb2fd60ea3a822.jpg)  \nation of cells\n\n![](images/ecb2734238b1eb3f469f8744545bf0e60744499f464a8b74673230f4e0e20365.jpg)  \nfig-21: Went experiment\n\nthe coleoptile tip exerted its effect by means of chemical stimulus rather than a physical stimulus such as an electrical impulse.

Such type of response of a plant to light is called photo tropism (photo means light, tropism means movement).\n\nWe know that roots always grow downwards. This means that plant respond positively for gravitational force. This is called geotropism.\n\nIf we observe plant which grow near a rock or wall side. You notice that all roots are growing in one direction, away from the rock or wall where water is available in the soil. This type of response to water is called hydrotropism.\n\nA very interesting thing in plants is movement of tendrils. All plants show positive response to phototropism. But in creepers like cucumber, bitter gourd, the stem is weak and thin. Hence plant cannot grow erect. Tendrils play a vital role to make the plant erect. Tendrils are thin thread like growths on the leaves or stems of climbing plant. They grow towards support and wind around them. This type of response to make contact or touch is called thigmo tropism.\n\n![](images/2d47d547410ca84d8477db85aebd495afcb7b882fbca61df09d94198bcf2d1d5.jpg)  \nfig-22: Tendrils\n\nIf you taste the carpel of a flower it is sweet. Let us recall butterflies fluttering on flowers for this nectar. Ripen stigma secretes sugary substance. This chemical substance stimulates the pollen grain which falls on the stigma. Pollen grain responds to this stimulus as pollen tubes grow to reach the ovule for fertilization. This type\n\nof response to chemicals is called chemo tropism. Unequal distribution of auxins affects the root and the stem growth. High concentration of auxin stimulates stem growth and inhibit root growth.\n\n![](images/1c609bdc3d7f43a24364cf635417b49cbb131f0eadf824e418643f0613cc8465.jpg)",

The process of development of young ones from unfertilized gametes is called parthenogenesis. (In greek partheno means virgin; genesis means production)\n\nWhat about animals?\n\nThis strange kind of reproduction occurs in animals like some species of ants, bees and wasps the fertilized ovum\n\n(zygote) develops into female and unfertilized ovum develops into male. In this process the sperms develop by mitotic division in male where as ova develop by meiotic division in female.\n\nParthenocarpy: Now a days we are able to develop seedless fruits like watermelon, grapes etc. Naturally in some plants like banana ovary directly develops into fruit without the process of fertilization this phenomenon is called as “Parthenocarpy” . These fruits are seedless.

Fertilisation may occur either outside the body of the female organism (external fertilisation) or inside the female’s body (internal fertilisation). As a matter of fact, the eggs of land animals are fertilised inside the body of the female organism. The fertilized egg (the zygote) start dividing and grow into the embryo.\n\nExternal fertilisation is a common in aquatic animals like most of the fishes and amphibians. The female lays a vast number of eggs in water and male animal release some millions of sperms on them. As the chance of fertilisation is controlled by nature which occurs externally, hence it is inevitable to produce a vast number of eggs and sperms.",

The ova develop in tiny cellular structures called follicles, which at first look like cellular bubbles in the ovary. They are called graafian follicles. As a follicle grows, it develops a cavity filled with fluid. Each follicle contains a single ovum which is formed after the process of cell division (meiosis).

This release of the egg or ovum is called ovulation.\n\nFallopian tubes : Generally the ovum enters the widened funnel of an oviduct (fallopian tube), a tube that extends from the neighbourhood of an ovary to the muscular, thick-walled uterus. Fertilization occurs as the ovum passes through the fallopian tubes thus begins a new life. The second phase of meiosis\n\nof ovum is carried out after the entry of sperm before fusing of both nuclei. After fusion of both nuclei the ovum transforms into zygote.\n\nThe zygote under goes mitotic division while travelling down in the fallopian tubes. By the time it reaches the uterus and transforms into a solid ball of cells.\n\nUterus : It is inverted pear shaped structure. The inner layer of uterus is called endometrium. The thickness of these layers increases gradually soon after menstruation. It will be ready to receive the embryo. If there is no fertilization the endometrium disintegrates and flows out as menstrual fluid. If there is fertilization the thickness of endometrium continues and\n\nready to receive the embryo. It provides nourishment and disposes of wastes of the developing embryo.\n\nThe fertilized ovum undergoes mitotic divisions, while it moves down the oviduct and finally attaches to the soft tissues of the uterus. Once attached, the embryo sinks into the soft inner uterine wall. This is called as implantation of embryo. Then certain cells of the embryo develop into\n\nmembranous structures that help to nourish, protect, and support the developing embryo. They are chorion, amnion, allantois, yolk sac.\n\nChorion: During the development of the embryo, tiny finger like projections grow from the surface of the outer membrane called chorion into the soft tissues of the uterus. Gradually, small pools of rapidly moving blood around these finger like projections in the uterine wall. These tissues of the chorion and the adjacent part of the uterine tissue make up the placenta.",

Usually at about the ninth month the head of the foetus is turned down towards the opening of the uterus. During birth, the head usually comes out first. Sometimes the feet come first; this makes the delivery more difficult. We still do not know much about the mechanism of child birth and how it is triggered.\n\nChildbirth begins when the muscle layers of the uterus starts to contract and relax rhythemically these actions are felt as labor pains. At first, muscular activity of the uterus is just strong enough to move the baby slowly toward the vagina, the outer canal of the female reproductive tract. Generally at this stage, the sac (amnion) around the baby breaks, and its fluid contents are released. This is a good sign that labour is well on its way. Then the contractions of the muscles become stronger and more frequent, and the baby is pushed out of the body through the vagina. Now the baby comes to this world.\n\nThe umbilical cord leading the baby to placenta, is tied off and cut by the doctor. (The small piece of cord remaining attached to the baby shrivels and falls off within a few days. The navel marks the place where it once\n\n![](images/38eabcc0c3bc8a9a6200ec0b04ad60f4798c676210cb95ebc9e03cc29ee7252d.jpg)\n\nentered the body.) After the birth of the baby, the muscular contractions of the uterus continue until they push out the tissues of the placenta, which are commonly called the “afterbirth.” During the end of pregnancy, a watery yellowish lymph like fluid called ‘colostrum’ accumulates in the mammary glands, which have gradually been enlarging and undergo transformation. For the first few days after the baby is born, the mammary glands secrete only colostrum. It is very important to feed this to the new born baby. It helps in developing the immune system of the child. After this milk will be screted. After child birth when production of milk stops menstural cycle will be started.\n\n![](images/552088794206323e099783dfa5168b582575b34d3ad349a8b60eeb3c751a3387.jpg)",

Depending upon the species of plant involved, an ovary may have one, two, several, or even hundreds of ovules. At the center of each ovule there is $\\mathrm { a }$ a microscopic embryo sac filled with food and water. The embryo sac is composed of gametophyte cells.\n\nThe majority of flowering plants have an embryo sac consisting of seven cells and eight nuclei. At first female gametocyte undergoes series of 3 mitotic cell divisions to form eight nucleate stage of embryosac. Among these one large central cell\n\n![](images/ab4ab63766445d1f101583ab8c0188b1dee9239509bb3d9d518d40f3b6413357.jpg)  \nfig-19: Pollen grain\n\n![](images/9f21c4ea25cca6e6b8d1ddc09727e73ac3d9198eded1e59360bda6b7f53fb314.jpg)  \nfig-20: Structure of gynoecium\n\ncontains two nuclei, called polar nuclei. Three cells move towards top end and are called antipodals. Three cells are grouped at micropylar end (place where pollen tube enters) of which two cells of this are called synergids and central one is egg cell. Cells on the surface of the stigma secretes a sticky nutrient fluid contains sugars and other substances. This will help the pollengrain to germinate. Then it forms pollen tube. It bears two nuclei. Soon after the tip of the pollen tube enters the embryo sac, the end of the tube ruptures and releases the two nuclei into the embryo sac.\n\nOne of the two nuclei fuses with the egg to form a zygote. It is called fertilization. By the time the egg cell has been fertilized, the two polar nuclei combine to form a single fusion nucleus. Now the second male\n\nnucleus deposited in the embryo sac by the pollen tube moves to the center and unites with the fusion nucleus. The zygote will develop into an embryonic plant within the ovule. Union of the fusion nucleus with the second male nucleus stimulates the formation of a new tissue the endosperm. In which, food materials are stored as development of the ovule proceeds.\n\n![](images/a5b3c79788fed220fb3e105b1f12374c8174dff9f949723845ee19f1ea5c2438.jpg)  \nfig-21: Fertilisation\n\nUnion of one nucleus with the egg, and the second nucleus with the fusion nucleus is called double fertilization. As far as we know, double fertilization occurs only in flowering plants. After double fertilization, the ovule increases in size rapidly as a result of the formation of endosperm tissue by mitosis and the development of the new embryo. The embryo consists of one or more cotyledons.R\n\nThe cotyledons develops by utilizing the food stored in endosperm. The cotyledons of some flowering plants, beans for example, digest, absorb, and store the foods from the endosperm as the ovule is maturing into a seed. As a consequence, the cotyledons become greatly enlarged because of stored food and the endosperm disappears more or less completely. Many other flowering plants (such as corn or castor), the endosperm tissue continues to grow as the ovule matures into a seed.",

This was one of the first attempts to understand the mechanism of cell division. He stated that binary fission of cells was the means of reproduction of animal cells. What happens during cell division could only be understood better when scientists came to know what is present inside the nucleus of the cell.\n\nIn 1879 Walther Flemming (1843–1905) examined many kinds of animal and plant cells and selected those that showed division. He reported from his observations of such cells that there were\n\nstring like structures in the nucleus which split longitudinally during cell division. He named such a process of division as mitosis (mitos- means fine threads) as the dividing structures resembled threads. He made a meticulous observation and made sketches and observed that there were a sequence of events in the process of division. A decade later these thread like structures were named as chromosomes (coloured bodies) as repeatedly in efforts to see them scientists were trying to use dyes to stain the nucleus and found that these structures were stained most often. His most important discovery was chromosomes appear double in nature.\n\nWilhelm Roux (1850-1924) proposed that chromosomes carried a different set of heritable elements and longitudinal splitting observed by Flemming, ensured the equal division of these elements. Combined with the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel’s 1866 paper on heritable elements in peas, these results highlighted the central role of the chromosomes in carrying heritable material (or genetic material). In cell division the cell divides into two halves with equal number of chromosomes which are similar to parent cell and are diploid in nature.\n\nBut the chromosomes number always remained the same. Biologists\n\nalso began to wonder about this. When cells divide, the daughter always have the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Let us assume that cell division is always preceded by mitosis. In case of man egg cells and sperm cells like other cells, must contain 46 chromosomes. But if\n\nthis were so, then the union of egg nucleus and sperm nucleus , which takes place during fertilization would produce a total of 92 chromosomes in zygote. If it continues this would be 184, 368 and so on. But the situation is not like that.\n\nAugust Weismann (1834-1914) a biologist hypothesised that\n\n1. In successive generations, individuals of the same species have the same number of chromosomes.   \n2. In successive cell division the number of chromosomes always remain constant.\n\n![](images/e838839800ce6b100b0bb7c4cb4b26995d442a91759935aebdb9ca529e22d017.jpg)  \nfig-26: August Weismann",

Cell division and function in a multicellular organism is highly regulated. It occurs only when there is a need for it.\n\nCells in some organs, such as heart and brain of an individual never divide. On the other hand bone marrow cells actively divide to produce red blood cells, which have a short life span 120 days in the body. For example, if you cut your finger and bleed, soon a blood clot forms to stop the bleeding. This brings in various chemicals to the site that stimulate skin cells to divide and heal the wound. Cell division ceases as the wound is completely healed. In contrast, cancer cells do not respond to such growth regulating factors and continuously divide at the expense of normal cells, thus ultimately killing the host. So it becomes important to understand the processes involved in cell division. The cell cycle will help us understand this better.\n\n![](images/82acf08e0d5d096292f118baeff089706232ef9265959dbc2e6fce1156b5408d.jpg)  \nfig-28: Interphase",

    "text": "The process of cell division is called ‘Mitosis’, which is completed in 40 to 60 minutes (this is the time of active division). The period between two cell divisions is called ‘Interphase’. This is actually the period when the genetic material makes its copy so that it is equally distributed to the daughter cells during mitosis. Interphase can be divided into three phases.\n\n1) G1 phase: This is the linking period between the completion of mitosis and\n\nthe beginning of DNA replication (Gap 1 phase). The cell size increase during this period.\n\n2) S phase: This is the period of DNA synthesis (Synthesis phase) leading duplication of chromosomes.   \n3) G2 phase: This is the time between the end of DNA replication and the beginning of mitosis.(Gap 2 phase). Cell organelles divide and prepare chromosome for mitosis.\n\nM phase: This is mitotic cell division phase. It includes prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase and cytokinesis.\n\nTo understand the functional relationship between these phases, Potu Narasimha Rao and Johnson (see annexure) conducted some experiments using the cell fusion technique. That is combining two cells in experimental conditions. With this cell fusion technique Johnson and Potu Rao revealed for the first time the structure of interphase(GI, S and G2) chromosomes that are not ordinarily visible under the microscope. They provided evidence on progression of cells through the cell cycle in sequential unidirectional and controlled way by a series of chemical signals that can diffuse freely between nucleus and cytoplasm. These experiments are considered to be a ‘mile stone’ in the cell cycle studies.",

    "text": "Why did the government of India fixed the legal marriage age of boys (21 years) and girls (18 years)?\n\nDo you feel that it is a social responsibility to control birth after having one or two children?\n\nWhat do you understand by the term ‘Healthy Society’?\n\nWill you encourage child marriage? Why?\n\nAs we have seen, the process of sexual maturation is gradual, and takes place while general body growth is still going on. Therefore, some degree of sexual maturation does not necessarily mean that the body or the mind is ready for sexual acts. Further, it is not fit for having and bringing up children. How do we decide if the body or the mind is ready for this major responsibility? All of us are under many different kinds of pressures about these issues. There can be pressure from our friends for participating in many activities, whether we really want or not. There can be pressure from families to get married and start having children. There can be pressure from government and voluntary organisations to avoid having children. In these situations, making right choices is important.\n\nIn the lesson $8 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ class “why do we fall ill”, we learnt that the diseases can be transmitted from person to person in a variety of ways. Since the sexual act is a very intimate connection of bodies, it is not surprising that many diseases can be sexually transmitted. These include bacterial infections such as Gonorrhoea and syphilis, and viral infections such as AIDS (Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome).\n\nWhat is the virus which causes AIDS?\n\nThese diseases spread by unsafe sexual contacts, using infected devices, infected blood transfusion, from an infected mother to child.\n\n![](images/7a9a0312e30f14dbcd5d69bb75af8ba966b7dc6de42028707b6b97143cee98b4.jpg)  \nfig-31: Red ribbon 1st December AIDS Day\n\nIt is very sad to say Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have the highest number of HIV positive patients in the country. According to survey conducted by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the state had 24 lakh HIV positive patients in the country during 2011-12.\n\nMaharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana are followed by Andhra Pradesh. Officials said that one in every 300 adults is suffering from HIV elsewhere.\n\nThe prevalence of HIV is 1.07 percent among males and 0.73 among female in the state, which again is higher than other states. Its prevalence among adults (15-49 years) 0.90 percent, pregnant women 1.22 percent in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nIlliteracy, poor health, unemployment, migration, non-traditional sex practise, unethical contacts and trafficking are some of the factors contributing to the spread of HIV in the state, according to experts.\n\nThe government established Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART centres) to supply medicine to HIV patients. Medical and health, family health departments AIDS control projects implementing various programmes like ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist), Red Ribbon Express, etc., to create awareness in society on the risks and symptoms of AIDS.\n\nInvite local health worker to your school and discuss about HIV and its impact on society.\n\nSocial discrimination against AIDS patients is also a social evil.

Pregnancy will make major demands on the body and the mind of the woman, and if she is not ready for it, her health will be adversely affected. Therefore, many ways have been devised to avoid pregnancy.\n\nThe prevention of pregnancy in women by preventing fertilisation is called contraception. Any device or chemical (drug) which prevents pregnancy in woman is called a contraceptive. The birth control methods can be of various types and can be used by any of the partners as preferable. Physical devices such as condoms and diaphragm (cap) are used. This\n\nprevents reaching of sperms to ova for fertilisation. This device not only prevents fertilisation but also transmitting some sexually transmitted diseases (STD) like gonorrhoea, syphilis and AIDS. No other method of contraception provides protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Chemicals in the forms of pills are induced either orally or inserting into female reproductive organ vagina. It contains hormones which stop the ovaries from releasing ovum into the oviducts. Now a days pills for males are also available. These pills kill the sperms and hence are called spermicides.\n\n![](images/2ea80ea15b4e94cce3142f060188e4eb4fca223b3ac7a1c7f563df8cc33ae0c9.jpg)  \ncopper - T\n\n![](images/dca8e148491982e71307b296a36fa81c1fa24d8dc28731fe175a0a7af23aa96a.jpg)  \nvasectomy - cut ends of vas deferens are sealed\n\n![](images/abd0a0954fa18096b81c0e94fa262dc7e01305aefd2517fb90b1a58cc2566406.jpg)  \nfig-32: Birth control methods\n\nThe use of intra-uterine device called copper-T, loop etc. are also very effective in preventing pregnancy. If a woman uses a copper-T as a method of contraception for avoiding unwanted pregnancies, they cannot protect her from acquiring sexually transmitted diseases. Surgical methods of birth control are available for males as well as females. In males a small portion of vas deferens (sperm ducts) is removed by surgical operation and both ends are tied properly. This method is called vasectomy. In females a small portion of oviducts (fallopian tube) is removed by surgical operation and the cut ends are tied. This prevents the ovum from entering into the oviducts. This method is called tubectomy.",

It has got some economic importance.\n\nIn grafting we can acquire desirable characters of plants.\n\nTissue culture is a modern technique of growing plants.

He completed his graduation in Agriculture and did his MS at IARI, New Delhi. Later, he went to USA for research. He worked on the cytogenetics of tobacco plant. During his research, a cell line called Hela, isolated from a human tumour was established in 1952 and received his PhD in 1963. He switched his attention from plant cytogenetic to the field of cancer cells. He conducted research in cell kinematics and studied extensively on the ‘triggering factor’ of cell division i.e mitosis.\n\n![](images/55ea8b4300d1f90fbf6848c3180ab672451fd0ad8454bac70026fbdf539b76a3.jpg)  \nDr. Potu Narasimha Rao\n\n![](images/b8fa4125c32b4ff6f480f33089b2696a9aaed092e8511079a99cfec515d8ccbb.jpg)  \nHe La Cell\n\nHe found that human cells either normal or cancer cells in culture media usually divide every 20 to 24 hours. But actually normal mitosis is completed in 40 to 60 minutes. The period in between two cell divisions is called interphase. The interphase further consists of 3 phases G1, S and G2 phases.\n\nTo understand the functional relationship between these phases of cell cycle. Dr.N.Rao and his research associate Dr.Johnson conducted experiments on cell fusion technique. His researches revealed that the cell cycle is sequential\n\nUnidirectional and controlled by a series of chemical signals. His experiments are considered to be a milestone in the cell cycle studies.This study threw a new hope of rayC for the budding scientists to carry out researches on cell division.

Did you ever imagine the complexity of your body? Different life processes in living organisms like respiration, digestion, blood circulation, excretion, nervous system etc., are inbuilt in our body at their specific places and carry out their specific functions in a coordinated manner. We have studied each of the processes in detail nearly in isolation except in the chapter on ‘Control and Coordination’. In this chapter, we shall go a step further to experience the complexities involved and appreciate the wonderful integration in our life processes.\n\nLet’s recall the parts of the digestive canal or gut, that are involved in the digestive process where the food is broken down at different stages.\n\nWrite down the parts of the gut where the journey of food starts from mouth to anus.\n\nWhich type of life processes would be involved in the breakdown of food in the stomach?\n\nIf any of those processes fail to function, what affect would it have on our body?\n\nEvery process is dependent on other to keep the body in good condition. To understand this concept we analyze how digestive system is coordinated with other systems as an example. We shall study the digestive system from feeling hungry to utilization of food (converting in to energy), illustrating the inter connected processes going on in our body.",

Levels of different substances are generally maintained in the blood mainly by our digestive system. One of the major substances is glucose. When its levels in the blood fall, we get hunger pangs in stomach. This again involves production of a series of proteins, some of which are hormones like Ghrelin. Secretion of the hormone “Ghrelin” starts in the stomach when it goes empty. Ghrelin is secreted from certain cells in the wall of the stomach. Hunger contractions (hunger pangs) start to occur in the stomach due to hunger generating signals that reach the brain from the stomach due to the secretion of this hormone. It is believed that the Diencephalon in fore brain and vagus nerve (( $1 0 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ cranial nerve) plays an important role in carrying these signals to the brain. Hunger pangs continue up to 30- 45 minutes. Increase in ghrelin levels results in sensation of hunger and motivation to consume food.\n\nWhich nervous system controlls the hunger pangs.\n\nWhat kinds of controls are exercised during sensation of hunger? Are they hormonal or neural or both?\n\nCan you suggest any 4 systems involved in the process of generating hunger sensation?\n\nWhen you feel your stomach is full and there is no need of food any\n\nmore, another hormone leptin is secreted that suppresses hunger.\n\nUsually we take food at a particular time. Every day we usually start feeling hungry at that time. You may have experienced this in your school during lunch hour.",

Record the time from placing sugar crystals to getting the taste .Or put a drop of sugar solutionT on your tongue using a dropper.\n\nCan we taste on dry tongue?\n\nWhich way helped you taste faster ? Why?\n\nBased on the above activity we know that taste can be identified easily when the tongue is pressed against the palate. As we know the tongue is sensory in function and contains taste buds. These taste buds are tiny papillae with an opening on top. Within them there are several taste sensitive cells. Any food substance when placed on the tongue gets dissolved in the saliva secreted by salivary glands in the mouth. When the tongue is pressed against the palate the food substance is pressed against the opening of the taste bud letting it to reach the taste cells and triggering taste signals. Finally the taste is recognized in the brain.\n\n![](images/a7899eda173ac5e393fdd71c509657528218b70e265ec62db30f5b8d6ab40a32.jpg)  \nfig-2: Tongue and palate\n\nObserve the flow chart what it indicates about the taste sense?\n\n![](images/f5bc7ce89e6ead681ee745dedb5cac836a93d6e7973d070916574571c39a1d7b.jpg)\n\nWhat do you think would happen if the salivary glands do not function in our mouth?\n\nSuppose your taste buds were affected what would happen to your interest in having food?",

As the food cannot be swallowed directly the teeth grind, chew and shred it. This process is called mastication. For this purpose the surface muscles of the jaw help in biting and chewing actions, and move the jaw up, down, forward and backward during food mastication. You may have observed your lower jaw moving up and down as you chew food. The teeth help in cutting and grinding while tongue movements evenly spread out the food and help in mixing it with saliva. The muscles of the mouth enable the food to be pushed in the oral cavity and to be moved around. The fifth cranial nerve has been found to control the movement of muscles in the jaw.\n\nDoes the level of saliva secretion increase due to presence of food in the mouth?\n\nCan the process of chewing go on in the absence of saliva?\n\nDoes the saliva have any other roles to play?\n\nLet us find out the role of saliva.",

Mucus lubricates and protects the oesophageal walls from damage. This helps the food bolus to slide down easily just as the oiled potatoes that move in the tube. Besides this, the saliva in the bolus also aids in easy movement of food, which moves into the stomach.\n\nThe wall of the oesophagus is made up of two kinds of smooth muscles. The inner layer consists\n\nof circular muscles and the outer layer of longitudinal muscles. Contraction of the circular muscles results in narrowing of the oesophagus just behind the bolus. So the food is squeezed downwards. Contraction of the longitudinal muscles infront of the bolus widen the tube, this results in shortening of that particular part of the oesophagus. Contraction and relaxation of these muscles bring in a wave like motion that propels the food bolus into the stomach by the action called as “peristalsis” (you have studied about this in the chapter on nutrition). This is involuntary and under the control of autonomous nervous system.\n\nWhat makes the movement of the food bolus in the oesophagus easy?\n\nThink why people are advised not to swallow food without chewing properly or do not eat in hurry.",

These carry messages in the form of nerve impulses to the brain. Brain analyses the message. These messages are transmitted from the brain through motor nerve to the wall of the stomach, and stimulate the gastric glands to produce gastric juice.\n\nThe walls of stomach secrete juice containing hydrochloric acid (HCl) Most of us may have experienced belching and the burning sensation after vomiting. What do you think may have caused the burning sensation?\n\nThese secretions are stimulated by the nervous system. The contraction of the stomach muscles squeeze and mix the food with the acids and juices of the stomach. These digestive juices turns the food into a smooth porridge like consistency called chyme. Some large protein molecules are also broken down here in to simple molecules.\n\nWhat stimulates stomach muscle into action?\n\nWhat causes the stomach to churn and mix the food?\n\nAs the process of digestion in the stomach nears completion, the contractions of the stomach decrease. What would be the reason? Which substance present in blood regulates contraction of stomach? This promptsG the muscles, called as pyloric sphincter at the opening of the stomach and the first part of the small intestine or duodenum, to relax. This opens the pathway into duodenum releasing the partially digested food (chyme) inN small quantities into the duodenum.\n\nWhy should only a small quantity of food be passed from stomachA to duodenum?\n\n![](images/855d5e3fe5ef77404a35f8c2c4bfa3f0b981aa2068f4e457a252ccc52a2ca528.jpg)  \nfig-7: Peristaltic movement in stomachT",

A wave of contraction followed by relaxation in muscles helps in forward movement of food.\n\nWhat is involved in bringing about peristalsis?\n\nWhat is the direction of peristalsis (which end of the gut does it begin)?\n\nWhat happens if the direction of peristalsis is reversed?C\n\nYou might have observed during peristalsis digested food is in the form of chyme gets reversed back in the oesophagus. Identify for the reverse peristalsis in fig.7.\n\nHave you observed a ruminating cow/ buffalo under a tree or somewhere else? Carefully observe its neck and throat. Do you see something moving from its throat to mouth? After that, the cow or buffalo starts chewing. It is the bolus moving from a part near the stomach of the animal to its mouth. It is reverse peristalsis. Though it is a common process in ruminants such\n\nas the cow, buffalo etc. that have an extra pouch in the stomach to store quickly swallowed food, in human beings it is mainly a protective mechanism to expell unwanted substances from the food canal.\n\nWe observe that digestion of food starts from the mouth. While the food passes through the gut the food settles for some time for digestion at certain locations. So food does not move uniformly through the digestive system. Let us observe the time period.\n\nTable-3   \n\n<table><tr><td>Percentage</td><td>Emptying of stomach</td><td>Emptying of small intestine</td></tr><tr><td>50%</td><td>2 1/2 to 3 hours</td><td>2½ hours</td></tr><tr><td>Total 100%</td><td>4 to 5 hours</td><td>30 to 40 hours\n(Transit through colon)</td></tr></table>\n\n(These are only averages. The movement of materials varies among individuals and time after different meals.)\n\nOur stomach is not like a bag with specific volume. It is like a pouch which is elastic in nature. the size of the stomach increases based on the food that we intake. Digestive juices are produced depending on the quantity of food material. If the stomach would produce same amount of digestive juices irrespective of the food quantity the walls of stomach would be destroyed. ( See annexure )\n\nWe also know that stomach secretes strong acids during digestion. The HCl secreted by the walls of the stomach is strong enough to digest the hard bones as well..Then how is the stomach protected from the secretions of its own acids. To understand this we will perform the following experiment.",

As a consequence, the intestine has developed a rich store of co ordinated movements of its muscular apparatus along with neural apparatus to ensure the appropriate mixing and propulsion of contents during digestion, absorption, and excretion.\n\nThe neural apparatus of our digestive tract comprises of such a vast and complicated network of neurons that it has been nicknamed by scientists as the second brain!\n\nResearch in this area is currently investigating how the second brain mediates the body’s immune response; after all, at least 70 percent of our immune system is aimed at the gut to expel and kill foreign invaders.\n\nScientists are also working to find out how trillions of bacteria in the gut ‘communicate’ with the cells of gut nervous system.\n\nA deeper understanding of this mass of neural tissue, filled with important neurotransmitters, is revealing that it does much more than merely handle digestion or inflict the occasional nervous pang of hunger. The little brain in our inner yards, in connection with the big one in our skull, partly determines our mental state and plays key roles in certain diseases throughout the body.\n\nOften you may have experienced that if you have tension for some reason you start having loose motions.

    "text": "Although its influence is far-reaching, the second brain is not the seat of any conscious thoughts or decision-making. Technically known as the enteric nervous system, the second brain consists of sheaths of neurons embedded in the walls of the long tube of our gut, or alimentary canal, which measures about nine meters end to end from the oesophagus to the anus. The second brain contains some 100 million neurons, more than in either the spinal cord or the peripheral nervous system. This multitude of neurons in the enteric nervous system enables us to “feel” the inner world of our gut and its contents. Stimulating and coordinating the breaking down of food, absorbing nutrients, and expelling of waste requires chemical processing, mechanical mixing and rhythmic muscle contractions that move everything down the line.\n\nThus equipped with its own reflexes and senses, the second brain can control several gut functions often independently of the brain. Several scientists also believe that the system is a way too complicated to have evolved only to make sure things move through and out of our gut smoothly.\n\n![](images/5e077724e2f1dcca54e17d5f1a7192bcddc0fc56154b17aca7ec5da97673b039.jpg)\n\nWhat moves out of the gut?\n\nTwo major pathways of waste expulsion are shown above. Which of the two do you think happens exclusively through the gut?\n\nImagine you made a roll by wrapping a hand full of left over tea leaves in a tissue paper. Later you press the roll gently and open it. What did you observe? You find the tissue paper had absorbed the water from the tea leaves.\n\nSimilarly when the unwanted waste material (stools / faeces) reach the large intestine. The peristaltic waves move the stool into the rectum. The left side of the colon acts like a storage tank of faeces. Water gets reabsorbed and the remaining wastes usually hard mass gets stored in the last part (Rectum) of the large intestine. This smelly yellowish faecal matter usually called as stool is later expelled out of the body through the anus.\n\nWhat controls the exit of stools from the body?\n\nDo you think the control is voluntary? Why / why not?\n\nThere are two muscular layers helping the exit of stool. Inner internal anal sphincter works as involuntary and other external anal sphincter works as voluntary control. These muscular structures help in opening and closing of the aperture of theE canal which are called as anal sphincter.\n\n![](images/102615e3ad8d59e43c8e5dd1856114eaabd2aeb04898996d12472d81cdcbc5b2.jpg)  \n1\n\nDid we have a sphincter in any other part of the digestive cannal?C\n\nWhere was it?\n\nSuppose a person has consumed more fluids than what the body actually need. How do think the extra fluid will be removed from the body?\n\nWe have so far seen how several systems work together to bring about the process of digestion. Where does this process draw energy from to run smoothly?\n\nWhat is the fate of the digested substances that move into blood from the intestine?",

During inhalation oxygen moves across the walls of the alveoli and enters the blood. From here it enters the red blood cells and gets distributed throughout the cells of our body. At the same time carbon dioxide from the blood moves into the alveoli of the lungs and breathed out during exhalation. Nutrients in the cells get oxidized and energy is released.\n\nWhere is the energy stored?\n\nWhich system do you think will remove the excess salts from our body?\n\nWhat would be the path of salt removal from gut to the out side of our body?\n\nDuring respiration we breathe continuously by inhaling and exhaling air. This is an involuntary process controlled by the medulla oblongata of the autonomous nervous system (ANS). During respiration the movement of inter costal muscles diaphragm moves the ribs cage inflating and deflating the lungs. Air containing more of oxygen enters the blood stream through lungs. If the oxygen has to reach the tissues it has to be circulated through blood. How does this process go on?\n\nHence the process of digestion which is a complex process that involves many organs and organ systems.

The chemoreceptors present in the nose and the tongue trigger signals in the form of nerve impulses to the brain where the smell and taste is detected.\n\nThe saliva secreted maintains an alkaline medium that aids in digestion of starch. Our mouth secretes acid as well ,this gives protection to our mouth from harmful bacteria etc., Under the action of autonomous nervous system Saliva released by the salivary glands moistens the food to make chewing and swallowing easier.\n\nThe muscular and sensory organ in the oral cavity is the tongue which is not only gustatory in function but also performs different functions including, shifting and mixing the food in the oral cavity and swallowing.\n\nThe mechanism for swallowing is coordinated by the swallowing centre in the brain stem.\n\nContraction and relaxation of the muscles in the gut brings in a wave like motion that propels the food forward and is called peristalsis. This is a muscular wave that travels the entire length of the food canal. This is involuntary and under the control of autonomous nervous system as well as gut nervous system.\n\nThe muscular contractions of the stomach churns the food into a semiliquid substance known as chyme. Entry of chyme into the duodenum is regulated by a muscle called as the pyloric sphincter. The strong acid (HCl) renders the pH in stomach acidic causing the protein digesting enzymes to swing into function.\n\nJuices secreted in the stomach breaks down the food into a smooth mixture called chyme.\n\nThe mucus lining of the stomach protects it from damage by its own acids.\n\nThe coordination among the processes of digestion, respiration and circulation is necessary for utilization and oxidation of food and transport of the nutrients.

The wound perforated the abdominal wall and stomach with profuse bleeding. Dr.Beaumont the army surgeon was called on to attend the wounded man. Dr. Beaumont cleaned the wound and pushed the protruding portions of lungs and stomach back into the cavity and dressed the wound.\n\nDr. Beaumont was surprised to see St. Martin alive the next day as he never expected so. With his medical expertise Dr. Beaumont treated the wound and did his best to extend his life. When the wound got healed completely, the stomach had fused with the body wall leaving a hole. Part of the wound formed a small flap that resembled a natural valve. This allowed Dr.Beaumont to draw out fluids from Martin’s stomach for testing.\n\nDr.Beaumont turned St.Martin to the left side depressing the flap he inserted a 5-6 inch tube into the stomach gathered gastric juice had its components identified. He introduced food through the hole of the stomach with a string attached to it so that he could retrieve the partially digested food for further examination. He conducted many experiments on food digestion to know the function of stomach which had not been done before. He discovered many things that were new to science.\n\nFor centuries stomach was thought to cook food by producing heat. Also theStomach was viewed as a mill,a fermenting vat or a stew pan. Through his experiments Dr.Beaumonts experiments revolutioned the concepts of digestion. June -on16,1822 became the beginning for the the most pioneering experiments in medicine. He recounted many of his observations and experiments in his journal which says “I consider myself but a humble experimentor “ in which the information provided still obeyed scientific method basing all the inferences on direct experimentation.\n\nSome of the discoveries of Dr.Beaumont were.",

He found the temperature being maintained constant ( 100F/38C ).   \n2) He found out that pure gastric juice contains large amounts of HCl ,contrary to the previous opinions that gastric was nothing but contains simply water. As suggested by some authors as the most general solvent in nature and of the alimentary canal. Even the hardest bone cannot with stand its action .Even outside the stomach its capable of effecting digestion. Based on the evidences he concluded that HCl as chemical agent that aids in chemical reaction.   \n3) He found Gastric juice is not stored in the stomach. But ,is secreted when the food is taken. When the food enters the stomach it excites the vessels to discharge its contents immediately for digestion.   \n4) He understood that digestion begins immediately when the food enters the stomach. He tested the contents of the stomach exactly 20mts after taking food (dinner containing ordinary food of boiled and salted beef, potatoes ,bread, beef and turnips) by collecting the fluids from the flap and found digestion had commenced and was progressing well at that time.   \n5) He also discovered that food in the stomach satisfies hunger even though its not eaten. (food reaching the stomach without passing the mouth and oesophagus). To confirm his assumptions he made St. Martin fast from breakfast time till $4 0$ Clock and then introduced food into the stomach through the flap. The sensation of hunger subsided.\n\nThough it was fortuitous experiments in medicine connected to digestion raised many questions.\n\nWhat is the cause of hunger?\n\nHow does the brain know the happenings of the stomach?\n\nWhat causes the gastric juices to secrete?\n\nHow and what makes the food to be mixed with the digestive juices?\n\nDoes the process of digestion occur independently or involves other systems like nervous and muscular as well ?",

When we say that something evolves, we mean not only that it changes, but that there is also some component of direction in that change.\n\nBut, how does evolution take place? Does it occur in a slow and steady manner or in quick jumps? Is it just about change and producing something new and different?\n\nIn the chapter on reproduction we had studied that reproductive processes usually give rise to individuals that have some new characters in spite of the similarity that they share with their parents. Often such new characters give rise to observable changes in life forms.\n\nHow are new characters produced?\n\nAre they inherited?\n\nDo they have any role in the process of evolution?\n\nIn this chapter we shall try to explore several such questions.",

(Hint: You know that seeds are formed from ovules)\n\nWhy variations are important? How are variations useful for an organism or a population?\n\nOver centuries variations and their role in nature have been studied by naturalists. During early $1 9 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century, a lot of work was done by several scientists. Some of these studies will help us to understand how variations occur and are transferred from one generation to the next. We shall study a detailed account of experimental evidences provided by Gregor Johann Mendel in the early $1 9 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century who is known as ‘Father of genetics’.\n\nIn 1857 Gregor Johann Mendel started working on the problem of how variations were passed from one generation to the other. Mendel did\n\nnot do his experimental work either in a University or in a Laboratory. As he was a monk in a monastery he simply did his experiments in the monastery garden. He worked for over seven years after which he presented the conclusions from his experimental data in the form of a detailed research paper.\n\nMendel made many careful observations of plants and found that pea plants would be most suitable to carry on further experimentation. Then he planned and designed the experiments to find out the answers to questions that came to his mind. He had worked on nearly 10,000 pea plants of 34 different varieties.\n\nObserving pea plants carefully, Mendel noted that they differ from one another in many ways. For example plants were tall or dwarf, seed shape round or wrinkled, seed coat (cotyledon) colour\n\nyellow or green. Thus, Mendel had chosen 7 pairs of contrasting characters for his study as shown in the table-3.\n\n![](images/46cd11816ac425fcc1bd2bcddfc9e76537342d3644d416ca505b797465751a5e.jpg)  \nfig-2: Gregor Johann Mendel\n\nTable - 3   \n\n<table><tr><td>Sl.No.</td><td>Character</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td>Colour of the flower</td><td>Purple or white</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Position of the flower</td><td>Either in axial or terminal in position.

    "text": "### Examples of experiments performed by Mendel\n\nThe following section shows number of experiments performed, number ofT fertilizations carried out and the number of plants involved in the study.\n\n![](images/56b089004f62205b707f0707b74cd2cbed2093576067c6c0e524aee6153c47fe.jpg)\n\n1. 1st experiment 60 fertilizations on 15 plants.   \n2. $2 ^ { \\mathrm { n d } }$ experiment 58 fertilizations on 10 plants.   \n3. 3rd experiment 35 fertilizations on 10 plants.   \n4. 4th experiment 40 fertilizations on 10 plants.   \n5. 5th experiment 23 fertilizations on 5 plants.   \n6. 6th experiment 34 fertilizations on 10 plants.   \n7. 7th experiment 37 fertilizations on 10 plants.\n\nMendel selected such kinds of plants that expresses a selected character over several generations. Such plants according to him were pure breed for that character. Mendel did the experiment with two pure breeds of peas for seed colour contrasting characters yellow and green, and they are represented as yellow with ‘Y’ and green with ‘y’. He started cross fertilizing pure breeds having contrasting characters.\n\nMendel started with two pure breeds of peas with different properties. We here take as an example a characteristic colour of the pea seeds yellow and green.\n\n![](images/371de881c05bef58367d8a24dd5a4705a1d9a606531c4baf1aecb389df6d2524.jpg)\n\n1. A set of peas (about $2 5 \\%$ ) gave only yellow seed giving pea plants.   \n2. Rest of the yellow seed giving pea plants gave about $50 \\%$ yellow and about $2 5 \\%$ green seed giving pea plants.   \n. $2 5 \\%$ pea plants gave only green seed giving pea plants.\n\nMendel made some assumptions by which he could explain his observations.\n\nAssumption 1: Every pea plant has two ‘factors’ which are responsible for producing a particular character or trait. The determining agent responsible for each trait is called a factor.\n\nMendel carefully choose the plants which did not produce a mixed result (pure). In our example of yellow and green peas, a pure breed (parental stage) will have both the ‘factors’ of the same type.\n\nA pure breed (parental) yellow seed giving pea will have both the ‘factors’ of the same type. Let us denote them by ‘YY’.\n\nA pure breed (parental) green seed giving pea will have both the ‘factors’ of the same type. Let us denote them by ‘yy’.\n\nAssumption-2 : During reproduction one ‘factor’ from each parent is taken to form a new pair in the progeny.\n\nAssumption-3 : One of these will always dominate the other if mixed together. The trait expressed in F1 generation is called dominant. While the other which did not express in F1 is called recessive.\n\nAssume that ‘Y’ (the one causing yellow colour) is a dominating ‘factor’. That means if ‘Y’ and ‘y’ come together ‘Y’ will dominate. Then the pea seeds will be always yellow in colour.\n\nFrom assumption-2, the breed after cross pollination will have one factor from pure breed yellow (Y) and one from the pure breed green (y). That is, all the peas will have the paired factor ‘Yy’ and by assumption-3 all the peas will be Yellow as ‘Y’ factor is dominant.\n\n![](images/9081ae0493aa8a6bcc71eaa9ff334d69359343bc231af44bd6d84370d5960259.jpg)\n\n![](images/1eb2cb62a1854b43fa45075d85fd6a96e20e5006ae6d243b1b1d9b1ebce7106c.jpg)\n\nParental generation - Cross pollination\n\n![](images/0abd1fdaefe677938b380719aec533473cebcfaba1d10766473f3bcd6a7fe8e8.jpg)\n\n<table><tr><td>♀♂</td><td>y</td><td>y</td></tr><tr><td>Y</td><td>Yy</td><td>Yy</td></tr><tr><td>Y</td><td>Yy</td><td>Yy</td></tr></table>\n\nYy ... .

The remaining pair is called allosomes or sex chromosomes. These are two types, one is ‘X’ and the other is ‘Y’. These two chromosomes determine the sex of an individual.

Then the baby will have XY condition. So the baby will be a boy.\n\nWhat will happen if the sperm containing X chromosomes fertilizes the ovum?\n\nWho decides the sex of the baby – mother or father?\n\nIs the sex also a character or trait?

Imagine at this point an elephant comes by and stamps on the bushes where the beetles live. This kills most of the beetles. By chance the few beetles survived are mostly blue. Again the beetle population slowly increases. But in the beetle population most of them are in blue colour. Thus sometimes accidents may also result in changes in certain characters of the a population. Characters as we know are governed by genes. Thus there is change in the frequency of genes in small populations. This is known as “Genetic drift’, which provides diversity in the population.\n\nLet us think of another situation:",

    "text": "In the olden days people believed that all the organisms on the earth had not undergone any change. Jean Baptist Lamarck was the first person to propose the theory of evolution. He thought that at some point of time in the history the size of giraffe was equal to that of deer. Due to shortage of food material on the ground and to reach the lower branches of trees giraffes started stretching their necks. Because of continuous stretching of neck, after several generations giraffes developed long necks. Such characters that are developed during the lifetime of an organism are called ‘acquired characters’. Lamarck proposed that these acquired\n\n![](images/004e378cd361704f2df72d521b9e41032534572db493722c1854786b7b2a2489.jpg)  \nfig-9: Jean Baptist Lamarck (1774-1829)\n\n![](images/2c57c59da1698b72c0fd97e1470d673a923bb31ddd990ac50b2d2e4cfd939166.jpg)\n\ncharacters are passed on to its offsprings i.e. to next generation and proposed the theory of ‘Inheritance of acquired characters’. For example elongation of neck and forelimbs in giraffe.\n\nBut August Weismann, tested this theory by an experiment on rats. He removed tails of parental rats. He observed that theirN offspring’s are normal with tails. He has done it again and again for twenty two generations but still offsprings are normal with tails. He proved that the bodily changes are not inherited. So they won’t be passed to it’s offsprings.\n\nDarwinismfig-10: Giraffee\n\nCharles Darwin proposed ‘Natural selection’ the famous ‘theory of evolution’.\n\n![](images/6179356ac2f58746f7d69de4c5f5a9a1fdd9bd8c42d9fa85772fc8d1838ec925.jpg)  \nfig-11: Charles Darwin (1809 – 1882)\n\nCharles Darwin (1809-1882) was born in England. He voyaged for five years, just when he was 22 years old. In the world survey ship HMS Beagle. He visited a number of places including Galapagos Islands. He keenly observed the flora and fauna of these places. He gathered a lot of information and evidences.\n\nDarwin observed a small group of related birds which are exhibiting diversity in structure in the Galapagos islands. These birds are Finch birds. Observe the fig-12. How do the beaks help them.\n\nHe was influenced by the book ‘Principles of geology’ written by Sir Charles Lyell. He suggested that geological changes occured\n\n![](images/09197ad3f418233cb2441cd360513a6a7ff1549e4ad22e4c66c558a989e69731.jpg)  \nfig-12: Some Darwin finches\n\nin a uniform rate, Darwin did not agree to this idea. He felt that large changes occured due to accumulation of small changes. Darwin was also influenced by the famous ‘Malthus theory’. This was written in ‘An essay on the principles of population’. Malthus observed that population grows in geometrical progression (1, 2, 4, 8, ......) where as food sources increases in arithmetic progression (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, .......).\n\nBased on these ideas, Darwin proposed the theory of “Natural selection”, which means that the nature only selects or decides which organism should survive or perish in nature. This is the meaning of survival of the fittest. The organisms with useful traits will survive. If traits are not usefull to organisms then they are going to be perished or eliminated from its environment.",

If we carefully observe the anatomy\n\nof all these animals, they show a common pattern in the arrangement of bones, even though their external form and functions are different. It indicates that all the vertebrates have evolved from a common ancestor and these organs are called homologous organs. This type of evolution is called divergent evolution.\n\nHowever, all similarities simply in organ shape are not necessarily to have a common ancestry.

When we observe, we find that the wings of bats have skin folds (patagium) stretched between elongated fingers. But the wings of birds have a feathery covering all along the arm. The designs of the two wings, their structure and components are different. They look similar because they have a common use for flying, but their origin is not common.

    "text": "Fossils are evidences of ancient life forms or ancient habitats which have been preserved by natural processes. Fossil evidence is typically preserved within the sediments deposited beneath water and land. They can be actual remains of once lived such as bones or seeds or even traces of past event such as dinosaur foot print or ripple marks on a pre-historic shore. Usually when organisms die, their bodies will be decomposed and lost. Sometimes the body or some parts of the body do not decompose\n\ncompletely. For example if a dead insect get caught in mud, it will not decompose quickly and the mud will eventually harden and retain the impression of the body parts of insect. All such preserved traces of extinct organisms are called fossils.\n\nGeologists can tell the age of a fossil. The study of fossil is called ‘Palaeontology’. Palaeontologists determine the age of fossil by using carbon dating method. The breakdown of radioactive isotopes of certain elements such as Carbon, Uranium and Potassium takes place at a known rate. So the age of rock or mineral containing isotopes can be calculated.\n\nCollect information about radio carbon dating method and radioactive isotopes and discuss with your teacher or from library display your collections in your class.\n\n![](images/dde493c6cd0064650109caecc6d673fa3dccc997a2a5f9c98c07a51dec98a79e.jpg)  \nfig-16: Dinosaur\n\nA rare and magnificient fossil of the dinosaurs, ketosaurs belonging to the lower Jurassic age going back to about 160 million years were collected from Yamanapalli in Adilabad district of Telangana.

We the present human beings are also have an evolutionary history like plant and other animals. Early man like forms appeared about 7 lakhs 50 thousand years ago. The first sure fossil of our own species of man the Homo sapiens, indicate that true man appeared on the earth 2 lakhs 50 thousand years ago.\n\nEvolution of man through ages:\n\nHomo habilus lived between 1.6 - 2.5 million years ago.\n\nHomo erectus lived between 1 - 1.8 million years ago.\n\nHomo sapiens neanderthalensis lived between 1,00,000 - 40,000 thousands years ago.\n\nHomo sapiens (present man) appeared about 10 thousand years ago.\n\nThere is a great diversity in human forms and features across the planet. So that for a long time, people used to talk about human ‘races’. Skin colour used to be the commonest way of identifying the so called races. Some were called black, some white or brown. A major question debated for long time was, have these apparent groups evolved differently? Over recent years, the evidence has become very clear. The answer is that there is no biological basis to the notion of human races. All humans are a single species with a common ancestor.\n\nNot only that, regardless of where we have lived for the past few thousand years, we all come from Africa. The earliest members of the human species, Homo sapiens, can be traced there. Our genetic footprints can be traced back to our African roots. A couple of hundred thousand years ago, some of our ancestors left Africa while others stayed on, while the residents spread across Africa. The migrants slowly spread across the planet –from Africa to west Asia, Then to Central Asia, Eurasia, South Asia, East Asia. They travelled down the island of Indonesia and the Philippines to Australia, and they crossed the Bering land bridge to the Americas. They did not go in a single line, so were not travelling for the sake of travelling, obviously. They went forwards and backwards, with groups sometimes separating from each other, even moving in and out of Africa. Like all other species on planet, they had come into being as an accident of evolution, and were trying to live their lives the best they could.\n\nThink why did ancient human beings travelled from one place to other and how did they travelled?",

    "text": "Variations are quite apparent among closely related groups of organisms.\n\nIn about 1857 Gregor Johann Mendel started working on the problem of how variations were passed from one generation to other.\n\nMendel had choosen seven distinguishing traits: flower colour, position, seed colour, shape, pod colour, pod shape, stem length.\n\nIn monohybrid experiment F1 generation express dominant trait (Eg: Yellow seeds).\n\nIn F2 generation about $7 5 \\%$ seeds were with dominant character (Eg: Yellow seeds) and about $2 5 \\%$ seeds were with recessive character (Eg: Green seeds). This is called phenotype and the ratio is 3:1.\n\nIn F2 generation out of $7 5 \\%$ , $2 5 \\%$ were pure yellow seeds $50 \\%$ were yellow seeds but green as a recessive factor. Remaining $2 5 \\%$ were pure green. This is called genotype and the ratio 1:2:1.\n\nEvery pea plant has two ‘factors’ which are responsible for producing a particular property or trait called allele.\n\nThe factors for each pair of characters assorts independently of the other pairs. This is known as “Law of independent assortment”.\n\nCrossing yellow and green seeds produced all yellow seeds. Because yellow is dominant factor.\n\nEach parent passes randomly selected copy (allele) of only one of these to its offspring.\n\nThe process of acquiring characters or traits from parents is called ‘Heredity’.\n\nEach human cell contains 23 pairs of chromosomes. Out of these 22 pairs are called autosomes and one pair is called allosomes.\n\nLamarck proposed that the acquired characters are passed to the offspring in the next generation. Each species tend to produce large number of offsprings, but only the fittest can survive.\n\nHomologous, analogous organs and embryological evidences explain evolutionary relationships. Some traits in different organisms would be similar because they are inherited from a common ancestor.\n\nFossils are evidences of ancient life forms or ancient habitats which have been preserved by natural processes.",

In this dihybrid cross, parents produce offsprings containing the factors for Characters (traits) of Yellow (YY), Round (RR), and wrinkled (rr), green (yy). These characters appeared independently without mixing with each other in F2 generation, which were produced by self pollination in F1 generation.\n\nObserve thc checker board given here carefully and note down different combinations of characters resulted from dihybrid cross.\n\n1. RRYY, 2. RRYy, 3. RrYY, 4. RrYy, 5. RRYy, 6. RrYY, 7. RrYy, 8. RrYy, 9. RrYy are having Round and Yellow seeds.   \n1. RRyy, 2. Rryy, 3. Rryy have Round and Green seeds   \n1. rrYY, 2. rrYy, 3. rrYy have Wrinkled and Yellow seeds   \n1. rryy have Wrinkled and Green seeds\n\nFrom the above results it can be concluded that the factors for each character or trait remain independent and maintain their identity in the gametes. The factors are independent to each other and passes to the offsprings (through gametes).\n\nIn the inheritance of more than one pair of characters (traits), the factors for each pair of characters assorted independently of the other pair. This is known as “Law of independent assortment”.\n\nMendel believed that every character or trait is controlled or responsible by a pair of factors. The factors which are responsible for a character or trait of an organism, now named as ‘genes’. The pair of genes which are responsible for a character are called as ‘alleles’. Alleles are of two types one is homozygous type (YY or RR) and the other is heterozygous (Yy or Rr).\n\n<table><tr><td>♀</td><td>R Y</td><td>R y</td><td>r y</td><td>r Y</td></tr><tr><td>R Y</td><td>RR YY</td><td>RR Yy</td><td>Rr Yy</td><td>Rr YY</td></tr><tr><td>R y</td><td>RR Yy</td><td>RR yy</td><td>Rr yy</td><td>Rr Yy</td></tr><tr><td>r y</td><td>Rr Yy</td><td>Rr yy</td><td>rr yy</td><td>rr Yy</td></tr><tr><td>r Y</td><td>Rr YY</td><td>Rr Yy</td><td>rr Yy</td><td>rr YY</td></tr></table>\n\n9 :3 :3 :1\n\nRound yellow   \nRound, green\n\nWrinkled, yellow   \nWrinkled, green",

    "text": "Everyone is familiar with one’s own surrounding. It plays an important role in the survival of all organisms. The sum of physical and biological factors along with their chemical interactions that affect an organism is called environment. The living organisms always try to maintain a balance among them selves and with biotic and abiotic factors. All components of biosphere interact in an organized manner with the organisms. This interaction assures an organism to survive that may result in gradual evolution of the organisms in the biosphere. The physical factors refer to abiotic factors (land, air, water sun light etc) and biological factors to biotic factors (flora and fauna). The place where an organisms lives is called habitat. An organism can’t completely defy the balance to suit one’s need. It would in some way or the other affect the balance in such a way that the survival of the organism affecting the damage would be at stake.\n\nYou have understood the relationships between organisms and their food in earlier classes with the help of food chains and food webs. Food chains are interconnected and when we try to observe these connections among a number of food chains then it becomes a food web. As you know a food chain shows who eats what in a particular habitat. The arrows between two organisms in the chain always point from the food to the feeder.\n\nIf we want to show a food chain consisting of grass, snake, rabbit and hawk then connect the given\n\n![](images/30018ff9d0d999713af49f739417dde3393bf6ab9f6a4064b00e58786704eae4.jpg)\n\n![](images/ca4dc9866c36f4fc4ba0be7432239032590cbb1d9e1bfb69d660be589f3852c3.jpg)\n\n![](images/5a5ef55448291c9c4496f0baaa1a2a1a0b98cde9e2fea1bb940e67ddeec919e1.jpg)\n\n![](images/0ecc8ebf3fefba8a34cfb18bc02e2d25792ff40ddc5dca9163a189f35996e7a8.jpg)  \nfig-1: Food relationship\n\norganisms by putting arrows and make a food chain.\n\nName the producer and consumers in the above food chain.\n\nTry to guess what does the arrows marked by you indicate?\n\nIdentify at least four other food chains in your surroundings.

In chapter 7 “Different Ecosystems” of class $8 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ it was mentioned that all organisms in an ecosystem derive energy from food to live and sunlight is the main source of the energy. Food chain shows that how the energy is passed from one organism to another. At each transfer a large proportion (80 toAt 90 percent) of energy is dissipated as heat produced during the process of respiration and other reactions. After three steps in a food chain, very little energy is still available for top carnivores to use.\n\nWithin the biosphere there are a number of major ecosystems. The terrestrial ecosystems are determined largely by the variations in climatic conditions between the Poles and Equator. In a similar way, if you climb a mountain such as Kilimanjaro in Equatorial Africa or Himalayan mountains in our country. You quickly go through a comparable system of ecosystems,\n\nstarting with tropical rain forest at the base and ending with perpetual snow and ice at the summit.\n\nThe main climatic influences which determine these ecosystems are rainfall, temperature and the availability of light from the sun. For instance, forests are usually associated with high rainfall, but the type of forest is influenced by temperature and light. The same applies to deserts which occur in regions where rainfall is extremely low.\n\nBut these links are never as simple or rigid as the word ‘chain’ suggests. For example, aphids are eaten by many insectivorous birds in addition to warblers, and also ladybirds and other insects; hawks, on the other hand, prey upon a considerable variety of birds and small mammal-So the term food web is often a better one to use when being precise, as it suggests a far greater number of possible links and reflects the fact that the whole\n\ncommunity is a complex inter-connected unit. Thus the original energy from the sun flows through the whole ecosystem from one tropic level to another.",

You will see from the diagram that animals fit into special positions within the food web; each is described as its niche. For instance, there is a niche for insects such as aphids which suck up the juices of leaves. Another niche for insects such as caterpillars which have strong jaws for biting off pieces of a leaf and a niche for relatively large animals such as deer which browse on the vegetation. All these animals feed on leaves but they differ both in size and in the manner in which they feed. So the term ‘niche’ denotes not only the animal’s position in the food web and what it eats, but also its mode of life. Just as a habitat is the place where an animal lives, so a niche describes its occupation the way it ‘goes about its business and earns its livings.\n\n![](images/1b2d62434a7dfc04cd560ee9ecb8da5c65a07c5228cba13d231b839e40d86dbd.jpg)  \nfig-2: Food chains in different ecosystems\n\nDiscuss one more example of niche with your teacher.",

Using biomass as fuel still puts carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, but it is the same carbon dioxide taken from the air as the biomass was produced.\n\nThe biomass in a trophic level may be more or less than the other trophic levels. Biomass is a measure of the amount of food available. When animals eat, only a small proportion of their food is converted into new tissue, which inturn forms the food for the next trophic level. Most of the biomass that animals eat is either not digested, or used to provide the energy needed for staying alive.\n\nThe biomass pyramid shows that animals are relatively inefficient in converting food into body tissues, the remaining part of the food being undigested is passed out as waste, or broken down in respiration to supply\n\nenergy for activities such as feeding. Many animals convert not more than $10 \\%$ of their food into their body tissues, in some herbivores, it is even less. Let us take an example of a food chain which has been worked out in some detail- one in which we are involved when we eat fish. In this chain the plant plankton on the surface of waters of sea are food producers. They trap energy from sunlight. The animal plankton feed on the microscopic plants and the fish in turn feed on the animal plankton; we are at the end of the chain when we eat the fish.",

    "text": "Food is the source of energy for organisms that are used in the growth and rebuilding the parts of the body; that are constantly wearing out. The food by its nature is the chemical energy and as in stored form, it is the potential energy. There are several mechanisms in organisms for continuous absorption of materials for the production of organic material, and for the release and conversion of organic material into inorganic form. Plants absorb the minerals from the soil. They are absorbed into the plant through roots.\n\n![](images/0000419f0caf1a4af97bf56920ce9e1aa38df2e9432a737e8488b58b444beb5b.jpg)  \nfig-7: Pyramid of Energy\n\nPhotosynthesis is an essential process for the life. The energy in sunlight, carbon dioxide and the water which are needed by all living things belong to nonliving things. As a result of photosynthesis, these can be made available in a suitable form of energy the food to the world of living things the animals or consumers, only by the green plants the producers. The food chains and food webs help in the transfer of the food and energy from the producers to different consumers. Animals obtain the minerals from the plant or animal food or both. Thus the mineral matter is constantly being removed from the earth to become a part of the plant, which may become a part of animal body.\n\nTry to identify the basic sources of various foods we eat. For example curd that we eat is processed from milk, which comes from a cow, which in turn eats grass. The grass carries out photosynthesis and prepares food. In every case, the origin of food materials can be traced back to green plants.\n\nOnce the food is eaten, its energy follows a variety of pattern through the organisms. Not all the food can be fully digested and assimilated. Hair, feathers, insect exoskeletons, cartilage and bone in animal foods, cellulose and lignin in plant foods cannot be digested by most animals. These\n\nmaterials are either ejected by defecation or regurgitated in pellets of indigested remains.\n\nAssimilated energy (that is not lost through respiration or excretion) is available for the synthesis of new biomass through growth and reproduction. Organisms lose some biomass by death, disease or annual leaf-drop, where they enter the detritus pathways of the food chain i.e., after the death and decomposition of organisms the materials flow back into the environment. The remaining biomass is eventually consumed by herbivores or predators and its energy there by enters the next higher trophic level in the ecosystem.\n\n![](images/d52b14d8ff5654d51b9ff18797e34775364b33270cc6e0df28529583d429d3a6.jpg)\n\nThe materials keep on cycling i.e. entering the living beings and through death and decay returning to the soil and atmosphere Such a flow of materials between organisms and their environment is called Cycling of materials or mineral circulation or Biogeochemical cycles (You have learnt in class IX ).\n\nEnergy enters the producers in the ecosystem from the sun in the form of solar energy or solar radiation. No other organisms except green plants and Photosynthetic bacteria due to the presence of chlorophyll are capable of absorbing solar energy and converting it into chemical energy (food).",

    "text": "From the producers, the chemical energy passes to the consumers from one tropic level to the next through food. At each trophic level, organisms use most of the food energy that they assimilate into their bodies to fulfill their metabolic requirements- performance of work, growth and reproduction. Because biological energy transformations are inefficient, a substantial proportion of metabolized food energy is lost, unused as heat. Hence pyramid of energy is always upright.\n\nOnly a small fraction goes to the eater at next trophic level. Organisms are no different from man-made machines in this respect. Most of the energy in gasoline is lost as heat in a car’s engine rather than being transformed into the energy of motion. In natural communities, energy used to perform work or dissipated as heat cannot be consumed by other organism and is forever lost to the ecosystem.",

    "text": "Fresh water lakes provide the nutritional requirements of the world’s poorest people. One such lake is Kolleru which is no ordinary wetland. It is one of the largest fresh water lakes in India, existing between West Godavari and Krishna districts of the state of Andhra Pradesh. The catchment of the lake extends up to $6 1 2 1 \\mathrm { k m } ^ { 2 }$ . The lake Kolleru discharges its excess water in to the Bay of Bengal through the twisty channel called Upputeru, which is about 65 km long. Nevertheless, the Kolleru wetland receives huge quantity of nutrient rich sediments from the flood plains of these rivers.\n\nIn November 1999, the Government of India had declared the lake as Bird Sanctuary. This lake is hosting 193 species of birds and a variety of flora and fauna, including medicinal plants. It attracts migratory birds from northern Asia and Eastern Europe between the months of October and March and it is estimated as 20,00,000 birds per year. The lake was also an\n\nimportant habitat for an estimated\n\n20 million residents. This largest sweet water lake has not only shrunk in size but faced great threat due to pollution in the last three decades as revealed by satellite pictures. The decrease in water area and muddy ground in the lake resulted in flooding problems in the lake area..\n\n![](images/241655ad1f273babb87df4ac2961bcda2f2b0ff9da36338aceb911f6c650c07f.jpg)  \nfig-7: Kolleru Lake\n\nTable-1   \n\n<table><tr><td>Cuases</td><td>Area in 1967 (Km2)</td><td>Area in 2004 (Km2)</td></tr><tr><td>Lake –water spread area</td><td>70.70</td><td>62.65</td></tr><tr><td>Lake with sparse weed</td><td>0</td><td>47.45</td></tr><tr><td>Lake with dense weed</td><td>0</td><td>15.20</td></tr><tr><td>Lake–liable to flood in rainy season</td><td>100.97</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Aquaculture ponds</td><td>0</td><td>99.74</td></tr><tr><td>Rice fields</td><td>8.40</td><td>16.62</td></tr><tr><td>Enchrochment</td><td>0.31</td><td>1.37</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>180.38</td><td>180.38</td></tr></table>\n\nIn which year lake-water spread area is more?

In 1996, almost entire lake was brought under cultivation and bunds were constructed to keep water out to protect the crops. This diversion affected the natural flow system of the lake. The water holding capacity of the lake is also found significantly reduced.\n\nIn due course of time activities such as agriculture and industries came along in ever growing intensity in the catchment area of the lake. Consequently, the drains and rivulets carry substantial quantity of various types of pollutants into the lake. The major sources of pollution are agricultural runoff containing residues of several agrochemicals, fertilizers, fish tank discharges industrial effluents containing chemical residues and different types of organic substances, municipal and domestic sewage. Excessive nutrient addition, especially from anthropogenic sources, led to explosive weed growth. Ex: Eichhornia, Pistia (Eutrophication).",

Suggest few remedial measures\n\nWhen a forest is cut down and a food crop is grown in its place, a natural established ecosystem with its vast number of species in a state of dynamic equilibrium is replaced by a monoculture i.e. an unnatural concentration of a single crop of various kinds grown in different fields to provide cereals or roots, others grass for domestic animals.\n\nWhen we grow crops in large concentrations we also get food in abundant quantities. This situation is optimum for pest, parasites like fungi to grow on this food material. If the quantities of food are larger then\n\nmultiplication of pests and parasites is rapid and the resulting damage would be great. To avoid such happening we have tried to eliminate these competitors for the crops by using toxic chemicals (pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides). Many of them have been very effective, but their use has also created new problems.\n\nThe perfect pesticide is the one which destroys a particular pest and is completely harmless to each and every other form of life, no such pesticide exists or likely to be.\n\nName any two pesticides/insecticides you have heard about?\n\nHow are the food grains and cereals being stored in your house and how do you protected them from pests and fungus?\n\nPesticides are often indiscriminate in their action and vast number of other animals may be destroyed. Some of these may be predators which naturally feed on these pests, others may be the prey for other animals. Thus causing unpredictable changes in food chains and upsetting the balance within the ecosystem.\n\nA further danger is that some have a cumulative effect. Pesticides vary in their length of “life” as toxic substances. Some of the pesticides as well as herbicides are degradable. They are broken down into harmless substances in a comparatively short time, usually a year. Others are non degradable, and include those which contain mercury, arsenic or lead. These non degradable pesticides are potentially dangerous as they accumulate in the bodies of animals and pass right through food web. Being further concentrated at each step until animals at the top of pyramid may receive enough to do considerable harm. The process of entry of pollutants into a food chain is known as Bioaccumulation, whereas the tendency of pollutants to concentrate as they move from one trophic level to the next is known as Biomagnification.",

Cyprinus carpio (common scale carp) is a cheap and high proteinaceous fish used as food for human beings, living in polluted EBWR was chosen for the study. Heavy metals in water samples and its bioaccumulation in various tissues including liver, kidney and gill of the fish growing in the reservoir were analyzed along with glycogen and lipids contents. A parallel study was conducted in water samples and fishes collected from Bibinagar, Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri district fresh water reservoir because it is less polluted, located $3 0 ~ \\mathrm { k m }$ from EBWR. The results obtained in present study revealed that the bioaccumulation is higher and the glycogen and lipid contents are lower in the fish of EBWR when compared to Bibinagar fresh water reservoir.\n\nThe water and fish samples were collected in three seasons namely pre-monsoon (February-May), monsoon (June-September) and post monsoon (October-January) in each year. Three water samples were collected in three stations, thrice in each season from each tank in cleaned polythene bottles. These are tightly stoppered and used for heavy metal analysis from June 2005 to May 2007.\n\nThe metal concentrations in EBWR reservoir were found to be higher than Indian standard limits and exhibiting the following sequence,\n\n$$\n\\mathrm {F e} > \\mathrm {P b} > \\mathrm {C r} > \\mathrm {N i} > \\mathrm {C d}.\n$$\n\nThe heavy metals could find their way into the human food chain, we analyzed bioaccumulation of these metals in the fish tissues. The bioaccumulation of these metals in fish tissues were of the following trend,\n\n$$\n\\mathrm {C d} > \\mathrm {C r} > \\mathrm {F e} > \\mathrm {N i} > \\mathrm {P b}.\n$$\n\nHigher bioaccumulation factors were found for Cd in liver, gill and kidney indicated the sensitivity of fish to this metal even at low concentrations.\n\nIt is found that the bioaccumulation was lesser in monsoon season than pre and post monsoon seasons.\n\nThe heavy metals could find their way into human beings through food chain. This bioaccumulation cause various physiological disorders such as hypertension, sporadic fever, renal damage, nausea, etc.",

Such increased bioaccumulation of heavy metals in fishes not only disturbs aquatic life but also increases health risk in human beings through food chain.\n\nWhere do the pollutants enter the water sources from?\n\nHow do heavy metals enter the fishes living in this water?\n\nResearchers found that pollution levels increase during monsoon season. Why they found so?\n\nWhy did people living in the areas near by the water reservoir, suffer from various diseases?\n\nIn many areas man has changed the natural ecosystems to a great extent by damming rivers, draining marshes, re-claiming land from the sea, cutting down forests, plough-ing up land and growing crops, and by building towns, cities, canals and motorways. These changes have greatly altered the communities of plants and animals living there.\n\nConsider the development of a large town, for example. There will be three kinds of change:\n\na) Some plants and animal species will die out.   \nb) Some will adapt to the new conditions sufficiently to survive in reduced numbers.   \nc) Some will benefit by the new conditions and will increase in numbers.",

This highly toxic chemical bioaccumulated in shellfish and fish in Minimata Bay and the Shiranui Sea, which, when eaten by the local population, resulted in mercury poisoning.

    "text": "Any living organism can’t avoid crises since they are a normal part of life. However, none have ever encountered a disaster on the level of\n\nthat which fell upon the Chinese Sparrows in 1958. The environmental crisis in question was not a natural one rather, it was manmade. In the entire history of sparrows around the world, they have never been hunted down as they were in China in 1958.\n\nA radical campaign to rapidly increase China’s industrial output by mobilizing the country’s vast rural peasantry took place at this time. It was set in motion\n\n![](images/5adadf52e5e116588cd808576a1dfdf59bffc835cd63572127f95b91f4e6d33b.jpg)  \nfig-9: Sparrow in danger\n\nby the government with the intention to achieve rapid increase in industrial production that China would catch up with the rest of the civilized world. China had an agrarian society then.\n\nOne of the most famous initiatives then was to form co-operatives or collectives up to 5,000 families and this initially yielded double the amount of crops grown. This initial success led to ambitious goals for the following year, but the weather didn’t cooperate. Even though fewer\n\n![](images/66d61e7558c287049c5defab42fd314782c7a892850530da12785dc8978af89c.jpg)  \nfig-10: Sparrow campaign\n\ncrops were harvested, rural officials overstated the amount of grain for fear of not meeting their quotas. This over-reporting led to an imbalance between the demand and the supply. The sparrows were accused of pecking away at the supplies in warehouses at an officially estimated rate of four pounds of grain per sparrow per year. In the cities and the outskirts, almost half of the labour force was mobilized into the anti-sparrow army.\n\nPeople started trapping, poisoning and killing sparrows in large numbers. Several free-fire zones were set up for shooting the sparrows. People would beat drums to scare the birds from landing, so the sparrows were forced to keep flying until they dropped dead from fatigue. Sparrow nests were torn down, eggs were broken, and nestlings were killed. Non-material rewards and recognition were offered to schools, work units and government agencies in accordance with the number of sparrows killed.\n\nLater some scientists who cut open the digestive systems of dead sparrows found that three-fourth of the contents were of insects harmful for crops and only one-fourth contained grains. The scientific findings\n\nshowed that sparrows were basically a beneficial bird for humans. Rather than being increased, crop yields after the campaign were substantially decreased. Though the campaign against sparrows ended it was too late. With no sparrows to eat the locust populations, the country was soon swarmed. Locusts coupled with bad weather led to the Great Chinese Famine. Use of pesticides against locust population further degraded the land.\n\nInstead of working in the fields, millions of farmers had to leave their villages to work for industries. Very small area was left under agriculture and food shortages became everyday occurrence.\n\nWhat is the food chain that has been discussed in the above case?\n\nHow did the campaign disturb the food chain in the fields?\n\nHow did these disturbances affect the environment?\n\nIs it right to eradicate a living organism in an ecosystem ?How is it harmful?",

    "text": "If we think about the ways through which we can prevent ourselves and other living beings from the harmful effects of the use of toxic material as pesticides, then the instant reaction may be to Ban the pesticides. It is easy to say “Ban all pesticides” but the pests still have to be kept in check. After using pesticides then also we are having a significant amount of loss of food material because of pests. Now you can imagine if pesticides were totally banned what would happen to the diseases? Are they really controlling the pests that effect the crops we vitally need for our growing population?\n\nThe long term solution to this problem is to find other effective methods of controlling pests which have far less harmful effects and are based on sound biological principles.\n\nHere are some of the important methods to be used.\n\nRotation of crops: Growing different crops on a particular piece of land in successive years reduces the occurence of pests and damage to the crops from year to year in that area.\n\nStudying the life histories of the pests: By understanding how the pests spread and its stages in life history, the seeds can be sown at that time to reduce the damage to the crop.\n\nBiological control: Introducing natural predators or parasites of the pests.\n\nSterility :Rendering the males of a pest species sterile\n\nGenetic strains: The development of genetic strains (genetically modified plants) which are resistant to certain pest.\n\nEnvironmental ethics: This is concerned with morality of human activities as they affect the environment. People need to know besides laws regarding environment there are some basic ethics what is right and what is wrong in view of environment.\n\nSo one should have awareness about our environment.

They formed groups of farmers including large and small ones who would use the same water resource. Farmers were also motivated to use irrigation techniques like drip irrigation, sprinklers etc.(collectively called as microirrigation techniques). Construction of soak pits to tap rainwater optimally was carried out as community efforts. Soakpits helped in recharging dried up bore wells. Dykes or barriers, nearly 30 cm thick of brick-cement or stone cement barrier, extending down to the compact bedrock, with mud or clay fillings were built in underground streams to tap ground water optimally.\n\nHow can wells be recharged?\n\nHow would recharging dried up wells help farmers of Vaddicherla?\n\nWhat does the case tell us about a water resource and its effect on farmers?",

In Australia, in response to chronic shortage resulting from drought, restrictions are imposed on activities like, watering lawns by using sprinkler systems, washing vehicles, using hose pipes to clean paved areas, and refilling swimming pools.\n\nThe population of human beings has grown enormously in the past two centuries. Billions of people use up resources quickly as they eat food, build houses, produce goods and burn fuel for transportation and electricity. The continuation of life as we know depends on the careful use of natural resources.\n\nThe need to conserve resources often conflicts with other needs. For some people, a forest area may be a good place to put a farm. A timber company may want to harvest the area’s trees for construction materials. A business company may want to build a factory or shopping mall on the land. All these needs are valid for us, but sometimes the plants and animals that live in the area are forgotten. The benefits of development need to be weighed against the harm to animals that may be forced to find new habitats,T the depletion of resources we may want in the future (such as water or timber), or damage to resources we use today.

    "text": "Why do you think forests are important?\n\nEvery continent except Antarctica has forests. Which are rich habitat for plants and animals. Forests serve as a lung for the world and a bed of nutrients for new life to prosper. They provide us innumerable products and in an urge to extract them we indiscriminately destroy them.\n\nPeople clear forests to use the wood, or to make way for farming or development. Each year, the Earth loses about 36 million acres of forest to deforestation.\n\nDeforestation destroys wildlife habitats and increases soil erosion. It also releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Deforestation accounts for 15 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation also harms the people who rely on forests for their survival, hunting and gathering, harvesting forest products, or using the timber for firewood.\n\nSustainable forestry practices are critical for ensuring resources well into the future. Perhaps the bishnoi’s of Rajasthan could tell us how. As we recall brave Amrita Devi and her daughters, followed by villagers who clung to trees in the forest surrounding their village and laid down their lives to save them, we are faced with a realization about how great a movement towards conservation can be. They were protesting against the Kings’ order to collect wood for the construction of his palace and defending the pledge of peaceful coexistence taken by them as a bishnoi. It is a set of 29 rules to conserve natures’ resources that every bishnoi vows to protect.\n\nAs you have already studied about the Chenchu and Gondu tribes of our state and are aware of how carefully they extract resources from nature and help revive it. (refer lesson of VII class - Forest our life)\n\nSome sustainable forestry methods include using low-impact logging practices, harvesting with natural regeneration in mind, and avoiding certain logging techniques, such as removing all the high-value trees or all the largest trees from a forest.\n\nTrees can also be conserved if consumers recycle. People in China and Mexico, for example, reuse much of their wastepaper, including writing paper, wrapping paper, and cardboard. If half the world’s paper were recycled, much of the worldwide demand for new paper would be fulfilled, saving many of the Earth’s trees. We can also replace some wood products with alternatives like bamboo, which is actually a type of grass, that grows very fast.",

Many other types of conservation efforts, such as plant conservation and animal conservation, depend on soil conservation.\n\nPoor farming methods, such as repeatedly planting the same type of crop in the same place, deplete nutrients in the soil. Soil erosion by water and wind increases when farmers plough up and down hills.\n\nOne soil conservation method is called contour strip cropping. Several crops, such as corn, wheat, and clover, are planted in alternating strips across a slope or across the path of the prevailing wind. Different crops, with different root systems and leaves, help to prevent soil erosion. Selective harvesting methods means we harvest mature commertial trees of a specific diameter on a rotational cycle to maintain the forest Ecobalance. Harvested areas are then closed for a prescribed period of time before the next harvest cycle in the same area. This provides younger trees a chance to grow full commertial potential while removing aged tress that would otherwise die naturally allowing forest to regenerate naturally.",

Scientists estimate that the current rate of extinction is 1,000 times the natural rate. Through hunting, pollution, habitat destruction, people are speeding up the loss of biodiversity at an alarming rate. It’s hard to know how many species are going extinct because the total number of species is unknown. Scientists discover thousands of new species every year. For example, after looking at just 19 trees in Panama, scientists found 1,200 different species of beetles 80 percent of them unknown to science at the time.

    "text": "“The interest in conservation is not a sentimental one but the discovery of a truth well known to our ancient sages. The Indian tradition teaches us that all forms of life - human, animal and plant are so closelyinter-linked that disturbance of one gives rise to imbalance in the other”. (By Srimati Indira Gandhi, while launching the world conservation strategy in India on $6 ^ { \\mathrm { { t h } } }$ March 1980).\n\nIn the 1960s most countries lived within their ecological resources. But the latest figure shows that today three-quarters of the human population live in countries which consume more than they can replenish. The issue of replenishment is large yet we have our individual roles.\n\nSmall steps could become great efforts at conservation. What does the Kothapally experience tell us about step towards management and conservation?\n\nYou may have already come across the four R’s to save the environment.\n\nThey are Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Recover.\n\n1. Reduce: We can save water by repairing leaky taps and avoiding a shower or switching off unnecessary lights and fans.\n\nThink of other things that you could reduce usage of.\n\nDo you think it is necessary to have a lot of lighting for decoration during celebrations?\n\n2. Reuse: things that you often tend to throw away, like paper and wrapping papers. This would save plants and minimise pollution.\n\nWhat other things could you reuse to save our resources?\n\n3. Recycle: It is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects (eg) some metals, glass, paper etc. Recycling may not always be a very good option as recycling plastic is a tricky process and can cause havoc. The chief problem lies in plastics’ complexity. There are as many types of plastic as their uses. Since each type can only be recycled with its own kind, plastics need to be carefully sorted before they can be processed.\n\nWhy should one sort wastes carefully before discarding them from home?\n\nOften we keep a plastic bag in our dustbins to discard waste, is it a good practise?\n\n![](images/86245a4bb5dd9e1086f77232d183c511aa1536aab3b452e05a71a7dd2c60455d.jpg)  \nfig-9: Bag from waste material\n\n![](images/ec6ef43d10b90fb58b7a18e2a0d34db33f5935291fc85b9809d308aa3f79118c.jpg)  \nfig-10: Recycling logo\n\n4. Recover: when we cut trees to construct industries or roads for transportation, it is important to grow trees in another areas.\n\nDiscuss about various programmes to implement ‘recover’ to prevent environmental threat.\n\nCollect information about technology used for transplantation of trees and discuss in your class room.",

Governments also enforce laws designed to protect the environment from pollution, such as requiring factories to install pollution-control devices. Finally, governments often provide incentives for conserving resources.\n\nMany international organizations are also dedicated to conservation. Members support causes such as saving rain forests, protecting threatened animals, and cleaning up the air.\n\nThe International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is an alliance of governments and private groups founded in 1948. The IUCN works to protect wildlife and habitats. In 1980, the group proposed a world conservation strategy. Many governments have used the IUCN model to develop their own conservation plans. In addition, the IUCN monitors the status of endangered wildlife, threatened national parks and preserves, and other environments around the world. Take Kothapally village as an example; discuss the role of organizations involved in conservation and that of the villagers.\n\nCan international, national or state organizations alone manage a resource? Who are all involved in the whole process of management?\n\nSuggest some ways in which you and your friends would like to manage a resource?\n\nAre we also an important resource of nature? How?\n\nFind out the usage of water in Litres per day in your home?

    "text": "The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning, which continues to shape our system, and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centered system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\n\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\n\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.",

    "text": "Development has many aspects. The purpose of this chapter is to enable students to understand this idea. They have to understand that people have different perspectives on development and there are ways by which we can arrive at common indicators for development. To do this, we have used situations that they can respond to in an intuitive manner; we have also presented analysis that is more complex and macro in nature.\n\nHow can countries or states be compared using some selected development indicators is another question that students would read about in this chapter. Economic development can be measured and income is the most common method for measuring development. However, the income method, though useful, has several weaknesses. Hence, we need newer ways of looking at development using indicators of quality of life and environmental sustainability.\n\nIt is necessary for you to expect the students to respond actively in the classroom and on a topic such as the above, there would be wide variation in opinion and possibility of debate. Allow students to argue their point of view. At the end of each section there are a few questions and activities. These serve two purposes: first, they recap the ideas discussed in the section and second, they enable better understanding of the themes\n\ndiscussed by bringing the learners closer to their real-life situations.\n\nThere are certain terms used in this chapter that would require clarification — Per Capita Income, Literacy Rate, Infant Mortality Rate, Attendance Ratio, Life Expectancy, Gross Enrolment Ratio, and Human Development Index. Though data pertaining to these terms are provided, these would need further explanation. You may also need to clarify the concept of Purchasing Power Parity that is used to calculate per capita income in Table 1.6. It is necessary to keep in mind that these terms are used as an aid to the discussion and not something to be memorised.",

    "text": "The data for this chapter is taken from reports published by the Government of India (Economic Survey, Report of the National Family Health Survey and Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy), United Nations Development Programme (Human Development Report) and World Bank (World Development Indicators). Many of these reports are being published every year. It may be interesting to look up these reports if they are available in your school library. If not, you may log on to the websites of these institutions (www.budgetindia.nic.in, www.undp.org, www.worldbank.org). Data is also available from the Reserve Bank’s Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy (available at www.rbi.org).\n\n\nThe idea of development or progress has always been with us. We have aspirations or desires about what we would like to do and how we would like to live. Similarly, we have ideas about what a country should be like. What are the essential things that we require? Can life be better for all? How should people live together? Can there be more equality? Development involves thinking about these questions and about the ways in which we can work towards achieving these goals. This is a complex task and in this chapter we shall make a beginning at understanding development. You will learn more about these issues in greater depth in higher classes. Also, you will find answers to many of these questions not just in economics but also in your course in history and political science. This is because the way we live today is influenced by the past. We can’t desire for change without being aware of this. In the same way, it is only through a democratic political process that these hopes and possibilities can be achieved in real life.\n\n![](images/2d9e31ea76e8fadbf6566a75e75dd0c0621d258979181ea58865fc10d6bed39c.jpg)  \n\"Without me they cannot develop.. in this system Icannot develop!\"",

In other words, they want more income.\n\nBesides seeking more income, oneway or the other, people also seek things like equal treatment, freedom, security, and respect of others. They resent discrimination. All these are important goals. In fact, in some cases, these may be more important than\n\nmore income or more consumption because material goods are not all that you need to live.\n\nMoney, or material things that one can buy with it, is one factor on which our life depends. But the quality of our life also depends on non-material things mentioned above. If it is not obvious to you, then just think of the role of your friends in your life. You may desire their friendship. Similarly, there are many things that are not easily measured but they mean a lot to our lives. These are often ignored.\n\nA demonstration meeting against raising the height of Sardar Sarovar Dam on Narmada River\n\n![](images/ea1c05b883796b05a7408661c07194e1e013917bff2ead925e44b126529d610f.jpg)\n\nHowever, it will be wrong to conclude that what cannot be measured is not important.\n\nConsider another example. If you get a job in a far off place, before accepting it you would try to consider many factors, apart from income, such as facilities for your family, working atmosphere, or opportunity to learn. In another case, a job may give you less pay but may offer regular employment that enhances your sense of security. Another job, however, may offer high pay but no job security and also leave no time for your family. This will reduce your sense of security and freedom.\n\nSimilarly, for development, Similarly, development, people look at a mix of goals. It is people look at a mix of goals true that if women are engaged in paid work, their dignity in the household and society increases. However, it is also the case that if there is respect for women there would be more sharing of housework and a greater acceptance of women working outside. A safe and secure environment may allow more women to take up a variety of jobs or run a business.\n\nHence, the developmental goals that people have are not only about better income but also about other important things in life.",

    "text": "You might ask if development can mean different things, how come some countries are generally called developed and others underdeveloped? Before we come to this, let us consider another question.\n\nWhen we compare different things, they could have similarities as well as differences. Which aspects do we use to compare them? Let us look at students in the class itself. How do we compare different students? They differ in their height, health, talents and interests. The healthiest student may not be the most studious one. The most intelligent student may not be the friendliest one. So, how do we compare students? The criterion we may use depends on the purpose of comparison. We use different criterion to choose a sports team, a debate team, a music team or a team to organise a picnic. Still, if for some purpose, we have to choose the criterion for the all-round progress of children in the class, how shall we do it?\n\nUsually we take one or more important characteristics ofimportant of persons and compare them based on these characteristics. on these characteristics. Ofon these characteristics. course, there can be differences about what are important characteristics that should form the basis of comparison: friendliness and spirit of cooperation, creativity or marks secured?\n\nThis is true of development too. For comparing countries, their income is considered to be one ofincome is be of the most important attributes.the important attributes. Countries with higher income are\n\nmore developed than others with less income. This is based on the understanding that more income means more of all things that human beings need. Whatever people like, and should have, they will be able to get with greater income. So, greater income itself is considered to be one important goal.\n\nNow, what is the income of a country? Intuitively, the income of the country is the income of all the residents of the country. This gives us the total income of the country.\n\nHowever, for comparison between countries, total income is not such an useful measure. Since, countries have different populations, comparing total income will not tell us what an average person is likely to earn. Are people in one country better off than others in a different country? Hence, we compare the average income which income is the total income of the country divided by its total population. The average income is also called per capita income.capita\n\nIn World Development Reports, brought out by the World Bank, this criterion is used in classifying countries. Countries with per capita income of US$ 49,300 per annum and above in 2019, are called high income or rich countries and those with per capita income of US$ 2500 or less are called low-income countries. India comes in the category of low middle income countries because its per capita income in 2019 was just $\\mathrm { U S } \\$ 8$ 6700 per annum. The rich countries, excluding countries of Middle East and certain other small countries, are generally called developed countries.",

Similarly, when we think of a nation or a region, we may, besides average income, think of other equally important attributes.\n\nWhat could these attributes be? Let us examine this through an example. Table 1.3 gives the per capita income of Haryana, Kerala and Bihar. Actually, these figures are of Per Capita Net State Domestic Product at Current Prices for 2018–19. Let us ignore what this complicated term exactly means.

This means that, on an average, a person in Haryana earned Rs 2,36,147 in one year whereas, on an average, a person in Bihar earned only around Rs 40,982. So, if per capita income were to be used as the measure of development, Haryana will be considered the most developed and Bihar the least developed state of the three.

    "text": "Infant Mortality Rate (or IMR) indicates the number of children that die before the age of one year asa proportion of looo live children born in that particular year.\n\nLiteracy Rate measures the proportion of literate population in the 7-and-above age group.\n\nNet Attendance Ratio is the total number of children of age group 14 and 15 years attending school as a percentage of total number of children in the same age group.\n\nWhat does this table show? The first column of the table shows that in Kerala, out of 1000 children born, 7 died before completing one year of age but in Haryana the proportion of children dying within one year of birth was 30, which is nearly three times more than that of Kerala. On the other hand, the per capita income of Haryana is more than that of Kerala as shown in Table 1.3. Just think of how dear you are to your parents, think of how every one is so happy when a child is born. Now, try to think of parents whose children die before they even celebrate their first birthday. How painful it must be to these parents? Next, note the year to which this data pertains. It is 2018. So we are not talking of old times; it is 70 years after independence when our metro cities are full of high rise buildings and shopping malls!\n\nThe problem does not end with Infant Mortality Rate. The last column of table 1.4 shows that about half of the children aged 14-15 in Bihar are not attending school beyond Class 8. This means that if you went to school in Bihar nearly half of your elementary class friends would be missing. Those who could have been in school are not there! If this had happened to you, you would not be able to read what you are reading now.\n\n![](images/4a19c79d932d1ae2475a4cf45fe3668ae89580d96c8b741d5bf3f6b6615eecb1.jpg)  \nMost babies do not get basic healthcare",

The reason is — money in your pocket cannot buy all the goods and services that you may need to live well. So,well. income by itself is not a completely adequate indicator of material goods and services that citizens are able to use. For example, normally, your money cannot buy you a pollution-free environment or ensure that you get unadulterated medicines, unless you can afford to shift to a community that already has all these things. Money may also not be able to protect you from infectious diseases, unless the whole of your community takes preventive steps.\n\n![](images/a3727bd0b6eb3eb21d87fdfbd2b8e94bba1c2b589cca7327e7354fd481cdbaf2.jpg)\n\nActually for many of the important things in life the best way, also the cheapest way, is to provide these goods and services collectively. Just think – will it be cheaper to have collective security for the whole locality or for each house to have its own security staff? What if no one, other than you, in your village or locality is interested in studying? Would you be able to study? Not unless your parents could afford to send you to some private school elsewhere. So you are actually able to study because many other children also want to study and because many people believe that the government should open schools and provide other facilities so that all children have a chance to study. Even now, in many areas, children, particularly girls, are not able to go to high school because the government/society has not provided adequate facilities.\n\n![](images/4c2d1653b2b92530d4a326e7126bcc5cede8c1b6df4965b7fd9d3e6d8bacf363.jpg)\n\nKerala has a low Infant Mortality Rate because it has adequate provision of basic health and educational facilities.

Let each student in the class find out his or her weight and height. Take the weight of each student in kilograms (kg). Then, take the height by drawing up a scale on the wall and measuring accurately with the head straight. Convert the height recorded in centimeters into meters. Divide the weight in kg by the square of the height. The number you get is called BMI. Then, look at the BMI-for-Age tables given on pages\n\n90–91. A student’s BMI could be within the normal range or less than that (underweight) or more (obesity). For example, if a girl student is 14 years and 8 month old and the BMI is 15.2, then she is undernourished. Similarly, if the BMI of a boy aged 15 years and 6 months is 28, then he is overweight.

    "text": "An economy is best understood when we study its components or sectors. Sectoral classification can be done on the basis of several criteria. In this chapter, three types of classifications are discussed: primary/secondary/tertiary; organised/ unorganised; and public/private. You can create a discussion about these types by taking examples familiar to the students and relate them to their daily life. It is important to emphasise the changing roles of sectors. This can be highlighted further by drawing attention of the students to the rapid growth of service sector. While elaborating the ideas provided in the chapter, the students may need to be familiarised with a few fundamental concepts such as Gross Domestic Product, Employment etc. Since the students may find this difficult to understand, it is necessary to explain to them through examples. Several activities and exercises are suggested in the chapter to help the students understand how a person’s activity could be placed whether in the primary, secondary or tertiary, organised or unorganised, and public or private sector. You may encourage the students to talk to various working people around them (such as shop owners, casual workers, vegetable vendors, workshop mechanics, domestic workers etc.) to know more about how they live and work. Based on such information, the students can be encouraged to develop their own classification of economic activities.\n\nAnother important issue to be highlighted is about the problems caused by the changes in the roles of sectors. The chapter has taken the example of unemployment and what the government can do to solve it. The declining importance of agriculture and growing importance of\n\nindustry and services should be related to the experience of the children by taking more examples that they may observe in their day-to-day life. Information derived from the media could be used for this purpose. You may encourage the students to bring important cuttings and stories from newspapers, which could be prominently displayed in storyboards, and encourage the class to discuss these issues. While discussing the unorganised sector, the key issue of protecting the workers engaged in the sector should be highlighted. You may also encourage the students to visit persons and enterprises in the unorganised sector and get a first hand experience from real life situation.",

    "text": "Let us look at these pictures. You will find that people are engaged in various economic activities. Some of these are activities producing goods. Some others are producing services. These activities are happening around us every minute even as we speak. How do we understand these activities? One way of doing this is to group them (classify them) using some important criterion. These groups are also called sectors.\n\n![](images/070ddc572749e50ca149773d1b897348266171997080c69dd995fec92a69ec0d.jpg)\n\n![](images/80002c90ad31b9640b9b0dbd569cf6559f2af62a69500614aa78ec161bc5abe6.jpg)\n\n![](images/d9650006e364cccc832cef6b726626a9ba3b13de09c7d045cd16fdc50cd2c130.jpg)\n\n![](images/92e96549c79404812c7ce9e12ecc3c1c248e6ca8e593b00d797b25b898a03cde.jpg)\n\n![](images/20c84418bc7097b06c19a6124cfd8af303a671a4c2755b9d797a728ecc8f0396.jpg)\n\nWe begin by looking at different kind of economic activities.\n\nThere are many activities that are undertaken by directly using natural resources. Take, for example, the cultivation of cotton. It takes place within a crop season. For the growth of the cotton plant, we depend mainly, but not entirely, not entirely, on natural factors like rainfall, sunshine and climate. The product of this activity, cotton, is a natural product. Similarly, in the case of an activity like dairy, we are dependent\n\n![](images/dfe960ca544ca32901aed5b5b242913acb91c04c09f4d5c60d7ebab7db5e77d9.jpg)\n\non the biological process of the animals and availability of fodder etc. The product here, milk, also is a natural product. Similarly, minerals and ores are also natural products. When we produce a good by exploiting natural resources, it is an activity of the primary sector. Why sector primary? This is because it forms the base for all other products that we subsequently make. Since most of the natural products we get are from agriculture, dairy, fishing, forestry, this sector is also\n\ncalled agriculture and related sector. sector\n\nThe secondary sector covers activities in which natural products are changed into other forms through ways of manufacturing that we associate with industrial activity. It is the next step after primary. The product is not produced by nature but has to be made and therefore some process of manufacturing is essential. This could be in a factory, a workshop or at home. For example, using cotton fibre from the plant, we\n\nspin yarn and weave cloth. Using sugarcane as a raw material, we make sugar or gur. We convert earth into bricks and use bricks to make houses and buildings. Since this sector gradually became associated with the different kinds of industries that came up, it is also called as industrial sector.",

These are activities that help in the development of the primary and secondary sectors. These activities, by themselves, do not produce a good but they are an aid or a support for the production process. For example, goods that are produced in the primary or secondary sector would need to be transported by trucks or trains and then sold in wholesale and retail shops. At times, it may be necessary to store these in godowns. We also may need to talk to others over telephone or send letters (communication) or borrow money from banks (banking) to help production and trade. Transport, storage, communication, banking, trade are some examples of tertiary activities. Since these activities generate services rather than goods, the tertiary sector is also called the service sector.service sector\n\nService sector also includes some essential services that may not directly help in the production of goods. For example, we require teachers, doctors, and those who provide personal services such as washermen, barbers, cobblers, lawyers, and people to do administrative and accounting works.

    "text": "With so many thousands of goods and services produced, you might think this is an impossible task! Not only would the task be enormous, you might also wonder how we can add up cars and computers and nails and furniture. It won’t make sense!!!\n\nYou are right in thinking so. To get around this problem, economists suggest that the values of goods and services should be used rather than adding up the actual numbers. For example, if 10,000 kgs of wheat is sold at Rs 20 per kg, the value of wheat will be Rs 2,00,000. The value of 5000 coconuts at Rs 15 per coconut will be Rs 75,000. Similarly, the value of goods and services in the three sectors are calculated, and then added up.\n\nRemember, there is one precaution one has to take. Not every good (or service) that is produced and sold needs to be counted. It makes sense only to include the final goods and services. services Take, for instance, a farmer who sells wheat to a flour mill for Rs 20 per kg. The mill grinds the wheat and sells the flour to a biscuit company for Rs 25 per kg. The biscuit company uses the flour and things such as sugar and oil to make four packets of biscuits. It sells biscuits in the market to the consumers for Rs 80 (Rs 20 per packet). Biscuits are the final goods, i.e., goods that reach the consumers.\n\nWhy are only ‘final goods and services’ counted? In contrast to final goods, goods such as wheat and the wheat flour in this example are intermediate goods. Intermediate goods are used up in producing final goods and services. The value of final goods already includes the already includes value of all the intermediate goods that are used in making the final good. Hence, the value of Rs 80 for the biscuits (final good) already includes the value of flour (Rs 25). Similarly, the value of all other intermediate goods would have been included. To count the value of the flour and wheat\n\n![](images/fde3e67ba09bf22d15010866ef1f1464a2f7b194461af784472e112d53b45146.jpg)\n\nseparately is therefore not correct because then we would be counting the value of the same things a number of times. First as wheat, then as flour and finally as biscuits.\n\nThe value of final goods and services produced in each sector during a particular year provides the total production of the sector for that year. A nd the sum of . production in the three sectors gives what is called the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Product (GDP) a country. It is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country during a particular year. GDP shows how big the economy is.\n\nIn India, the mammoth task of measuring GDP is undertaken by a central government ministry.

    "text": "Generally, it has been noted from the histories of many, now developed, countries that at initial stages of development, primary sector was the most important sector of economic activity.\n\nAs the methods of farming changed and agriculture sector began to prosper, it produced much more food than before. Many people could now take up other activities. There were increasing number of craftpersons and traders. Buying and selling activities increased many times. Besides, there were also transporters, administrators, army etc. However, at this stage, most of the goods produced were natural products from the primary sector and most people were also employed in this sector.\n\nOver a long time (more than hundred years), and especially because new methods of manufacturing were introduced, factories came up and started expanding. Those people who had earlier worked on farms now began to work in factories in large numbers. They were forced to do so as you read in history chapters. People began to use many more goods that were produced in factories at cheap rates. Secondary sector gradually became the most important in total production and employment. Hence, over time, a shift had taken place. This means that the importance of the sectors had changed.\n\nIn the past 100 years, there has been a further shift from secondary to tertiary sector in developed countries. The service sector has become the most important in terms of total production. Most of the working people are also employed in the service sector. This is the general pattern observed in developed countries.\n\nWhat is the total production and employment in the three sectors in India? Over the years have there been changes similar to the pattern observed for the developed countries? We shall see in the next section.",

    "text": "Over the forty years between 1973-74 and 2013-14, while production in all the three sectors has increased, it has increased the most in the tertiary sector. As a result, in the year 2013-14, the tertiary sector has emerged as the largest producing sector in India replacing the primary sector.\n\nWhy is the tertiary sector becoming so important in India? There could be several reasons.\n\nFirst, in any country several services such as hospitals, educational institutions, post and telegraph services, police stations, courts, village administrative offices, municipal corporations, defence, transport, banks, insurance companies, etc. are required. These can be considered as basic services. In a developing country the government has to take responsibility for the provision of these services.\n\nSecond, the development of agriculture and industry leads to the development of services such as\n\ntransport, trade, storage and the like, as we have already seen. Greater the development of the primary and secondary sectors, more would be the demand for such services.\n\nThird, as income levels rise, certain sections of people start demanding many more services like eating out, tourism, shopping, private hospitals, private schools, professional training etc. You can see this change quite sharply in cities, especially in big cities.\n\nFourth, over the past decade or so, certain new services such as those based on information and communication technology have become important and essential. The production of these services has been rising rapidly. In Chapter 4, we shall see examples of these new services and the reasons for their expansion.\n\nHowever, you must remember that not all of the service sector is growing equally well. Service sector in India employs many different kinds of people. At one end there are a limited number of services that employ highly skilled and educated workers. At the other end, there are a very large number of workers engaged in services such as small shopkeepers, repair persons, transport persons, etc. These people barely manage to earn a living and yet they perform these services because no alternative opportunities for work are available to them. Hence, only a part of this sector is growing in importance. You shall read more about this in the next section.",

    "text": "Graph 2 presents percentage share of the three sectors in GDP. Now you can directly see the changing importance of the sectors over the forty years.\n\n![](images/0e3f8ae01a75509ad786b174fca0a4e4f88fdae65cab492252063de43ef7afd3.jpg)\n\nA remarkable fact about India is that while there has been a change in the share of the three sectors in GDP, a similar shift has not taken place in employment. Graph 3 shows the share of employment in the three sectors in 1977-78 and 2017-18. The primary sector continues to be the largest employer even now.\n\n![](images/c909fc5fd82007785ac1a0c2d208e52278e34201b565b8a0ffb512645a7b2a64.jpg)\n\nWhy didn’t a similar shift out of primary sector happen in case of employment? It is because not enough jobs were created in the secondary and tertiary sectors.\n\nEven though industrial output or the production of goods went up by more than nine times during the period, employment in the industry went up by around three times. The same applies to the tertiary sector as well. While production in the service sector rose by 14 times, employment in the service sector rose around five times.\n\nAs a result, more than half of the workers in the country are working in the primary sector, mainly in agriculture, producing only about one sixth of the GDP. In contrast to this, the secondary and tertiary sectors produce the rest of the produce whereas they employ less about half the people. Does this mean that the workers in agriculture are not producing as much as they could?\n\nWhat it means is that there are more people in agriculture than is necessary. So, even if you move a few people out, production will not be affected. In other words, workers in the agricultural sector are underemployed. underemployed\n\nFor instance, take the case of a small farmer, Laxmi, owning about two hectares of unirrigated land dependent only on rain and growing crops, like jowar and arhar. All five members of her family work in the plot throughout the year. Why? They have nowhere else to go for work. You will see that everyone is working, none remains idle, but in actual fact, their labour effort gets divided. Each one is doing some work but no one is fully employed. This is the situation of underemployment, where people are apparently working but all of them are made to work less\n\nthan their potential. This kind ofkind underemployment is hidden in contrast to someone who does not have a job and is clearly visible as unemployed. Hence, it is also called disguised unemployment. called disguised unemployment.\n\nNow, supposing a landlord, Sukhram, comes and hires one or two members of the family to work on his land. Laxmi’s family is now able to earn some extra income through wages. Since you do not need five people to look after that small plot, two people moving out does not affect production on their farm. In the above example, two people may move to work in a factory. Once again the earnings of the family would increase and they would also continue to produce as much from their land.",

This means that even if we remove a lot of people from agricultural sector and provide them with proper work elsewhere, agricultural production will not suffer. The incomes of the people who take up other work would increase the total family income.\n\nThis underemployment can also happen in other sectors. For example there are thousands of casual workers in the service sector in urban areas who search for daily employment.

    "text": "From the above discussion, we can see that there continues to be considerable underemployment in agriculture. There are also people who are not employed at all. In what ways can one increase employment for people? Let us look at some of them.\n\nTake the case of Laxmi with her two-hectare plot of unirrigated land. The government can spend some money or banks can provide a loan, to construct a well for her family to irrigate the land. Laxmi will then be able to irrigate her land and take a second crop, wheat, during the rabi season. Let us suppose that one hectare of wheat can provide employment to two people for 50 days (including sowing, watering, fertiliser\n\napplication and harvesting). So, two more members of the family can be employed in her own field. Now suppose a new dam is constructed and canals are dug to irrigate many such farms. This could lead to a lot of employment generation within the agricultural sector itself reducing the problem of underemployment.\n\nNow, suppose Laxmi and other farmers produce much more than before. They would also need to sell some of this. For this they may be required to transport their products to a nearby town. If the government invests some money in transportation and storage of crops, or makes better rural roads so that mini-trucks reach everywhere several farmers like Laxmi, who now have access to water, can continue to grow and sell these crops. This activity can provide productive employment to not just farmers but also others such as those in services like transport or trade.\n\nLaxmi’s need is not confined to water alone. To cultivate the land, she also needs seeds, fertilisers, agricultural equipment and pumpsets to draw water. Being a poor farmer, she cannot afford many of these. So,\n\nshe will have to borrow money from moneylenders and pay a high rate of interest. If the local bank gives her credit at a reasonable rate of interest, she will be able to buy all these in time and cultivate her land. This means that along with water, we also need to provide cheap agricultural credit to the farmers for farming to improve. We will look at some of these needs in Chapter 3, Money and Credit.",

    "text": "Another way by which we can tackle this problem is to identify, promote and locate industries and services in semi-rural areas where a large number of people may be employed. For instance, suppose many farmers decide to grow arhar and chickpea (pulse crops). Setting up a dal mill to procure and process these and sell in the cities is one such example. Opening a cold storage could give an opportunity for farmers to store their products like potatoes and onions and sell them when the price is good. In villages near forest areas, we can start honey collection centres where farmers can come and sell wild honey. It is also possible to set up industries that process vegetables and agricultural produce like potato, sweet potato, rice, wheat, tomato, fruits, which can be sold in outside markets. This will provide employment in industries located in semi-rural areas and not necessarily in large urban centres.\n\nWhat groups of people do you 1thinkare unemployed or underemployed in your area? Can you think of some measures thatcould be taken up for them?\n\nDo you know that in India about 60 per cent of the population belongs to the age group 5-29 years? Out of this, only about 51 per cent are attending educational institutions. The rest and particularly those aged less than 18 years may be at home\n\n![](images/2574bb2390ce517801e472a7ede80dca1b330ac072d7070f6367aaaf9b745328.jpg)  \nGur Making in Haryana\n\nor many of them may be working as child labourers. If these children are to attend schools, we will require more buildings, more teachers and other staff. A study conducted by the erstwhile Planning Commission (now known as NITI Aayog) estimates that nearly 20 lakh jobs can be created in the education sector alone. Similarly, if we are to improve the health situation, we need many more doctors, nurses, health workers etc. to work in rural areas. These are some ways by which jobs would be created and we would also be able to address the important aspects of development talked about in Chapter 1.\n\nEvery state or region has potential for increasing the income and employment for people in that area. It could be tourism, or regional craft industry, or new services like IT. Some of these would require proper planning and support from the government. For example, the same study by the Planning Commission says that if tourism as a sector is improved, every year we can give additional employment to more than 35 lakh people.\n\nWe must realise that some of the suggestions discussed above would take a long time to implement.

He gets no other allowances apart from his wages. He is not paid for the days he does not work. He has therefore no leave or paid holidays. Nor was he given any formal letter saying that he has been employed in the shop. He can be asked to leave anytime by his employer.\n\nDo vou see the differences in the conditions of work teeween Kanta and Kamal?\n\nKanta works in the organised organised sector. Organised sector covers those enterprises or places of work where the terms of employment are regular and therefore, people have assured work. They are registered by the government and have to follow its rules and regulations which are given in various laws such as the Factories Act, Minimum Wages Act, Payment of Gratuity Act, Shops and Establishments Act etc. It is called organised because it has some formal processes and\n\nprocedures. Some of these people may not be employed by anyone but may work on their own but they too have to register themselves with the government and follow the rules and regulations.\n\nWorkers in the organised sector enjoy security of employment. They are expected to work only a fixed number of hours. If they work more, they have to be paid overtime by the employer. They also get several other benefits from the employers. What are\n\nthese benefits? They get paid leave, payment during holidays, provident fund, gratuity etc. They are supposed to get medical benefits and, under the laws, the factory manager has to ensure facilities like drinking water and a safe working environment. When they retire, these workers get pensions as well.\n\nIn contrast, Kamal works in the unorganised sector. The unorganised sector sector is characterised by small and scattered units which are largely outside the control of the government. There are rules and regulations but these are not followed. Jobs here are low-paid and\n\noften not regular. There is no provision for overtime, paid leave, holidays, leave due to sickness etc. Employment is not secure. People can be asked to leave without any reason. When there is less work, such as during some seasons, some people may be asked to leave. A lot also depends on the whims of the employer. This sector includes a large number of people who are employed on their own doing small jobs such as selling on the street or doing repair work. Similarly, farmers work on their own and hire labourers as and when they require.",

    "text": "The organised sector offers jobs that are the most sought-after. But the employment opportunities in the organised sector have been expanding very slowly. It is also common to find many organised sector enterprises in the unorganised sector. They adopt such strategies to evade taxes and refuse to follow laws that protect labourers. As a result, a large number of workers are forced to enter the unorganised sector jobs, which pay a very low salary. They are often exploited and not paid a fair wage. Their earnings are low and not regular. These jobs are not secure and have no other benefits.\n\nSince the 1990s, it is also common to see a large number of workers losing their jobs in the organised sector. These workers are forced to take up jobs in the unorganised sector with low earnings. Hence, besides the need for more work, there is also a need for protection and support of the workers in the unorganised sector.\n\nWho are these vulnerable people who need protection? In the rural areas, the unorganised sector mostly comprises of landless agricultural labourers, small and marginal farmers, sharecroppers and artisans (such as weavers, blacksmiths, carpenters and goldsmiths). Nearly 80 per cent of rural households in India are in small and marginal farmer category. These farmers need to be supported through adequate facility for timely delivery of seeds, agricultural inputs, credit, storage facilities and marketing outlets.\n\nIn the urban areas, unorganised sector comprises mainly of workers in small-scale industry, casual workers in construction, trade and transport etc., and those who work as street vendors, head load workers, garment makers, rag pickers etc. Small-scale industry also needs government’s support for procuring raw material and marketing of output. The casual workers in both rural and urban areas need to be protected.\n\nWe also find that majority of workers from scheduled castes,\n\ntribes and backward communities find themselves in the unorganised sector. Besides getting the irregular and low paid work, these workers also face social discrimination. Protection and support to the unorganised sector workers is thus necessary for both economic and social development.\n\n![](images/d07ff84e01f08622e3625a93f288137fed89e0131906cddfab447d5d1378a6b3.jpg)\n\nWhen factories close down, many once regular workers are found selling goods or pushing a cart or doing some other odd job",

    "text": "Another way of classifying economic activities into sectors could be on the basis of who owns assets and is responsible for the delivery of services. In the public sector public , the government owns most of the assets and provides all the services. In the private private sector, ownership of assets and delivery of services is in the hands of private individuals or companies. Railways or post office is an example of the public sector whereas companies like Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited (TISCO) or Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) are privately owned.\n\nActivities in the private sector are guided by the motive to earn profits.\n\nTo get such services we have to pay money to these individuals and companies. The purpose of the public sector is not just to earn profits. Governments raise money through taxes and other ways to meet expenses on the services rendered by it. Modern day governments spend on a whole range of activities. What are these activities? Why do governments spend on such activities? Let’s find out.\n\nThere are several things needed by the society as a whole but which the private sector will not provide at a reasonable cost.at a reasonable cost. Why? Some ofat reasonable cost. these need spending large sums of money, which is beyond the capacity\n\nof the private sector. Also, collecting money from thousands of people who use these facilities is not easy. Even if they do provide these things they would charge a high rate for their use. Examples are construction of roads, bridges, railways, harbours, generating electricity, providing irrigation through dams etc. Thus, governments have to undertake such heavy spending and ensure that these facilities are available for everyone.\n\nThere are some activities, which the government has to support. The the to support private sector may not continue their production or business unless government encourages it. For example, selling electricity at the cost of generation may push up the costs of production of goods in many industries. Many units, especially small-scale units, might have to shut down. Government here steps in by producing and supplying electricity at rates which these industries can afford. Government has to bear part of the cost.\n\nSimilarly, the Government in India buys wheat and rice from farmers at a ‘fair price’. This it stores in its godowns and sells at a lower price to consumers through ration shops. You have read about this in the chapter on Food Security in Class IX. The\n\ngovernment has to bear some of the cost. In this way, the government supports both farmers and consumers.\n\nThere are a large number of activities which are the primary responsibility of the government. The government must spend on these. on these. Providing health and education facilities for all is one example. We have discussed some of these issues in the first chapter. Running proper schools and providing quality education, particularly elementary education, is the duty of the government. India’s size of illiterate population is one of the largest in the world.",

We have also seen\n\nwhat all can be done for increasing employment opportunities in the country. Another classification is to consider whether people are working in organised or unorganised sectors. Most people are working in the unorganised sectors and protection is necessary for them. We also looked at the difference between private and public activities, and why it is important for public activities to focus on certain areas.",

    "text": "Money is a fascinating subject and full of curiosities. It is important to capture this element for the students. The history of money and how various forms were used at different times is an interesting story. At this stage the purpose is to allow students to realise the social situation in which these forms were used. Modern forms of money are linked to the banking system. This is the central idea of the first part of the chapter.\n\nThe present situation in India, where newer forms of money are slowly spreading with computerisation of the banking system, offers many opportunities to students to explore on their own. We need not get into a formal discussion of the ‘functions of money’ but let it come up as questions. There are certain areas that are not covered, such as ‘creation of money’ (money multiplier) or the backing of the modern system that may be discussed if you desire.\n\nAs you would see in the chapter, the stock of money consists of currency held by the public and the demand deposits that they hold with the banks. This is the money that people can use as they wish and the government has to ensure that the system works smoothy. What would happen when the government declares that some of the currency notes used by people would be made invalid and would be replaced by new currency? In India, during November 2016, currency notes in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 were declared invalid. People were asked to surrender these notes to the bank by a specific period and receive new Rs. 500, Rs. 2,000 or other currency notes. This is known as ‘demonetisation’. Since then, people were also encouraged to use their bank deposits rather than cash for transactions. Hence, digital transactions started by using bank-to-bank transfer through the internet or mobile phones, cheques, ATM cards, credit cards, and Point of Sale (POS) swipe machines at shops. This is promoted to reduce the requirement of cash for transactions and also control corruption. Students could be asked to debate on the process and the impact of demonetisation. They can be guided to make\n\na collage of the major areas where people use digital and cash transactions which are legitimate and legal. They can also discuss the transactions which are legal and why. It is also important to intimate students that different types of plastic cards are used in place of cash transactions but not all of them money per se.",

What are the aspects that one looks at in any credit arrangement and how this affects people is the main focus of the second part of the chapter. The world around us offers a tremendous variety of such arrangements and it would be ideal to explain these aspects of credit from situations that are familiar to your students. The other crucial issue of credit is its availability to all, especially the poor, and on reasonable terms. We need to emphasise that this is a right of the people and without which a large section of them would be kept out of the development process. There are many innovative interventions, such as that of Grameen Bank, of which students may be made familiar with but it is important to realise that we don’t have answers to all questions.

    "text": "The use of money spans a very large part of our everyday life. Look around you and you would easily be able to identify several transactions involving money in any single day. Can you make a list of these? In many of these transactions, goods are being bought and sold with the use of money. In some of these transactions, services are being exchanged with money. For some, there might not be any actual transfer of money taking place now but a promise to pay money later.\n\nHave you ever wondered why transactions are made in money? The reason is simple. A\n\nperson holding money can easily exchange it for any commodity or service that he or she might want. Thus everyone prefers to receive payments in money and then exchange the money for things that they want. Take the case of a shoe manufacturer. He wants to sell shoes in the market and buy wheat. The shoe manufacturer will first exchange shoes that he has produced for money, and then exchange the money for wheat. Imagine how much more\n\ndifficult it would be if the shoe manufacturer had to directly exchange shoes for wheat without the use of money. He would have to look for a wheat growing farmer who not\n\nI’LL GIVE YOU SHOES FOR YOUR WHEAT.\n\nonly wants to sell wheat but also wants to buy the shoes in exchange.

The modern currency is without any use of its own.\n\nThen, why is it accepted as a medium of exchange? It is accepted as a medium of exchange because the currency is authorised by the government of the country.\n\nIn India, the Reserve Bank of India issues currency notes on behalf of the central government. As per Indian law, no other individual or\n\norganisation is allowed to issue currency. Moreover, the law legalises the use of rupee as a medium of payment that cannot be refused in settling transactions in India. No individual in India can legally refuse a payment made in rupees.

For instance, workers who receive their salaries at the end of each month have extra cash at the beginning of the month. What do people do with this extra cash? They deposit it with the banks by opening a bank account in their name. Banks accept the deposits and also pay an amount as interest on the deposits. In this way people’s money is safe with the banks and it earns an amount as interest. People also have the provision to withdraw the money as and when they require. Since the deposits in the bank accounts can be withdrawn on demand, these deposits are called demand deposits.\n\nDemand deposits offer another interesting facility.

    "text": "Let us take the story of banks further. What do the banks do with the deposits which they accept from the public? There is an interesting mechanism at work here. Banks keep only a small proportion of their deposits as cash with themselves. For example, banks in India these days hold about 15 per cent of their deposits as cash. This is kept as provision to pay the depositors who might come to withdraw money from the bank on any given day. Since, on any particular day, only some of its many depositors come to withdraw cash, the bank is able to manage with this cash.\n\nBanks use the major portion of the deposits to extend loans. There is a\n\nhuge demand for loans for various economic activities. We shall read more about this in the following sections. Banks make use of the deposits to meet the loan requirements of the people. In this way, banks mediate between those who have surplus funds (the depositors) and those who are in need of these funds (the borrowers). Banks charge a higher interest rate on loans than what they offer on deposits. The difference between what is charged from borrowers and what is paid to depositors is their main source of income.\n\nWhat do you think would happen if all the depositors went to ask fortheir 'money atthesame etime?\n\n![](images/39d4ce782b3bfa1e5edb151c99affe8618f8af23d8ef128f6f0866067a16a2dd.jpg)",

Till a few years back, he would borrow money from the village moneylender at an interest rate of five per cent per month (60% per annum). For the last few years, Shyamal has been borrowing from an agricultural trader in the village at an interest rate of three per cent per month. At the beginning of the cropping season, the trader supplies the farm inputs on credit, which is to be repaid when the crops are ready for harvest.\n\nBesides the interest charge on the loan, the trader also makes the farmers promise to sell the crop to him. This way the trader can ensure that the money is repaid promptly. Also, since the crop prices are low after the harvest, the trader is able to make a profit from buying the crop at a low price from the farmers and then selling it later when the price has risen.\n\n![](images/6b333f751c5fa5231b483ed010b9724b94b10eda283b77e43b7ff102917df4a1.jpg)\n\nnext meet Arun who is supervising the work of one farm labourer.

    "text": "We have seen in the above examples that people obtain loans from various sources. The various types of loans can be conveniently grouped as formal sector loans sector loans andsector informal sector loans.informal sector loans\n\nAmong the former are loans from banks and cooperatives. The informal lenders include moneylenders, traders, employers, relatives and friends, etc. In Graph 1 you can see the various sources of credit to rural\n\nhouseholds in India. Is more credit coming from the formal sector or the informal sector?\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India supervises the functioning of formal sources of loans. For instance, we have seen that the banks maintain a minimum cash balance out of the deposits they receive. The RBI monitors the banks in actually maintaining cash balance. Similarly,\n\n![](images/86ee9401c98d9b6cbb03bd214f0229267ad68802188b041a836c3eb478d39d26.jpg)  \nGraph 1 : Sources of Credit per Rs 1000 of Rural Households in India in 2012\n\nthe RBI sees that the banks give loans not just to profit-making businesses and traders but also to small cultivators, small scale industries, to small borrowers etc. Periodically, banks have to submit information to the RBI on how much they are lending, to whom, at what interest rate, etc.\n\nThere is no organisation which supervises the credit activities of lenders in the informal sector They\n\n![](images/ba7d4c84bb62b2f140b13b9464e6617c0b0638d3bca65d260b380d6a5495d574.jpg)\n\nchoose. There is no one to stop them from using unfair means to get their money back.\n\nCompared to the formal lenders, most of the informal lenders charge a much higher interest on loans. Thus, the cost to the borrower of informal loans is much higher.\n\nHigher cost of borrowing means a larger part of the earnings of the borrowers is used to repay the loan. Hence, borrowers have less income left for themselves (as we saw for Shyamal in Sonpur). In certain cases, the high interest rate for borrowing can mean that the amount to be repaid is greater than the income of the borrower. This could lead to increasing debt (as we saw for Rama in Sonpur) and debt trap. Also, people who might wish to start an enterprise by borrowing may not do so because of the high cost of borrowing.\n\nFor these reasons, banks and cooperative societies need to lend\n\nmore. This would lead tohigher incomes and many people could then borrow cheaply for a variety of needs. They could grow crops, do business, set up smallscale industries etc. They could set up new industries or trade in goods. Cheap and affordable credit is crucial for the country’s development.",

    "text": "Graph 2 shows the importance of formal and informal sources of credit for people in urban areas. The people are divided into four groups, from poor to rich, as shown in the figure. You can see that 85 per cent of the loans taken by poor households in the urban areas are from informal sources. Compare this with the rich urban households. What do you find? Only 10 per cent of their loans are from informal sources, while 90 per cent are from formal sources. A similar pattern is also found in rural areas. The rich households are availing cheap credit from formal lenders whereas the poor households have to pay a large amount for borrowing.\n\nWhat does all this suggest? First, the formal sector still meets only about half of the total credit needs of the rural people. The remaining credit needs are met from informal sources.\n\n![](images/208593d3dc7603d9da63f55f5865ab72b26213cd94096e8a9fd94ad45d41835b.jpg)  \nGraph 2 : Of all the loans taken by urban housholds, what percentage was formal and what percentage was informal?   \npoor   \nhousholds\n\n![](images/fc4024a367560a760a64d359d69e7fb9f1c8dc30f750abc65adf3d5d338ccd34.jpg)  \nhouseholds   \nwith few assets\n\n![](images/a33be741bfe66cb43f17dee26c3c70050b00ea9809011627b4f999168d7cae9f.jpg)  \nwell-off   \nhouseholds\n\n![](images/46881a7e7be9d6e16886ef7e84fa7f8a441f2c3acd4065af017235a7cdab5eb6.jpg)  \nrich   \nhouseholds\n\nBLUE : Per cent of loans from the INFORMAL sector\n\nPURPLE : Per cent of loans from the FORMAL sector\n\nMost loans from informal lenders carry a very high interest rate and do little to increase the income of the borrowers.

At these loans. present, it is the richer households who receive formal credit whereas the poor have to depend on the informal sources.

    "text": "In the previous section we have seen that poor households are still dependent on informal sources of credit. Why is it so? Banks are not present everywhere in rural India. Even when they are present, getting a loan from a bank is much more difficult than taking a loan from informal sources. As we saw for Megha, bank loans require proper\n\ndocuments and collateral. Absence of collateral is one of the major reasons which prevents the poor from getting bank loans. Informal lenders such as moneylenders, on the other hand, know the borrowers personally and hence are often willing to give a loan without collateral. The borrowers can, if necessary, approach the moneylenders even without repaying\n\ntheir earlier loans. However, the moneylenders charge very high rates of interest, keep no records of the transactions and harass the poor borrowers.\n\nIn recent years, people have tried out some newer ways of providing loans to the poor. The idea is to organise rural poor, in particular women, into small Self Help Groups (SHGs) and pool (collect) their savings. A typical SHG has 15-20 members, usually belonging to one neighbourhood, who meet and save regularly. Saving per member varies from Rs 25 to Rs 100 or more, depending on the ability of the people to save. Members can take small loans from the group itself to meet their needs. The group charges interest on these loans but this is still less than what the moneylender charges. After a year or two, if the group is regular in savings, it becomes eligible for\n\navailing loan from the bank. Loan is sanctioned in the name of the group and is meant to create selfemployment opportunities for the members. For instance, small loans are provided to the members for releasing mortgaged land, for meeting working capital needs (e.g. buying seeds, fertilisers, raw materials like bamboo and cloth), for housing materials, for acquiring assets like sewing machine, handlooms, cattle, etc.\n\nMost of the important decisions regarding the savings and loan activities are taken by the group members. The group decides as regards the loans\n\nto be granted — the purpose, amount, interest to be charged, repayment schedule etc. Also, it is the group which is responsible for the repayment of the loan. Any case of non-repayment of loan by any one member is followed up seriously by other members in the group. Because of this feature, banks are willing to lend to the poor women when organised in SHGs, even though they have no collateral as such.\n\nThus, the SHGs help borrowers overcome the problem of lack of collateral. They can get timely loans for a variety of purposes and at a reasonable interest rate. Moreover, SHGs are the building blocks of organisation of the rural poor. Not only does it help women to become financially self-reliant, the regular meetings of the group provide a platform to discuss and act on a variety of social issues such as health, nutrition, domestic violence, etc.\n\n![](images/52359d57a9a549f1dc7a7423912ab92fd69685bad2b8c46732936b498200eb8a.jpg)  \nA women's self-help group",

    "text": "In this chapter we have looked at the modern forms of money and how they are linked with the banking system. On one side are the depositors who keep their money in the banks and on the other side are the borrowers who take loans from these banks. Economic activities require loans or credit. Credit, as we saw can have a positive impact, or in certain situations make the borrower worse off.\n\nCredit is available from a variety of sources. These can be either formal sources or informal sources. Terms of\n\ncredit vary substantially between formal and informal lenders. At present, it is the richer households who receive credit from formal sources whereas the poor have to depend on the informal sources. It is essential that the total formal sector credit increases so that the dependence on the more expensive informal credit becomes less. Also, the poor should get a much greater share of formal loans from banks, cooperative societies etc. Both these steps are important for development.",

    "text": "Most regions of the world are getting increasingly interconnected. While this interconnectedness across countries has many dimensions cultural, political, social and economic — this chapter looks at globalisation in a more limited sense. It defines globalisation as the integration between countries through foreign trade and foreign investments by multinational corporations (MNCs). As you will notice, the more complex issues of portfolio investment have been left out.\n\nIf we look at the past thirty years or so, we find that MNCs have been a major force in the globalisation process connecting distant regions of the world. Why are the MNCs spreading their production to other countries and what are the ways in which they are doing so? The first part of the chapter discusses this. Rather than relying on quantitative estimates, the rapid rise and influence of the MNCs has been shown through a variety of examples, mainly drawn from the Indian context. Note that the examples are an aid to explain a more general point. While teaching, the emphasis should be on the ideas and examples are to be used as illustrations. You can also creatively use comprehension passages like the one given after Section II to test and reinforce new concepts.\n\nIntegration of production and integration of markets is a key idea behind understanding the process of globalisation and its impact. This has been dealt with at length in this chapter, highlighting the role of MNCs in the process. You have to ensure that the students grasp this idea with sufficient clarity, before moving on to the next topic.\n\nGlobalisation has been facilitated by several factors. Three of these have been highlighted: rapid improvements in technology, liberalisation\n\nof trade and investment policies and, pressures from international organisations such as the WTO. Improvement in technology is a fascinating area for students and you may, with a few directions, encourage them to do their own explorations. While discussing liberalisation, you have to keep in mind that the students are unaware of what India was like in the pre-liberalisation era. A role-play could be conceived to compare and contrast the pre and post-liberalisation era. Similarly, international negotiations under WTO and the uneven balances in power are interesting subjects that can be covered in a discussion mode rather than as lectures.\n\nThe final section covers the impact of globalisation. To what extent has globalisation contributed to the development process? This section draws on the topics covered in Chapters 1 and 2 (for example, what is a fair development goal), which you can refer to. Also, examples and activities drawn from the local environment are a must while discussing this section. This might include contexts that have not been covered in the chapter, such as the impact of imports on local farmers, etc. Collective brainstorming sessions can be conducted to analyse such situations.",

    "text": "In general, MNCs set up production where it is close to the markets; where there is skilled and unskilled labour available at low costs; and where the availability of other factors of production is assured. In addition, MNCs might look for government policies that look after their interests. You will read more about the policies later in the chapter.\n\nHaving assured themselves of these conditions, MNCs set up factories and offices for production. The money that is spent to buy assets such as land, building, machines and other equipment is called investment.investment. Investment made by MNCs is called foreign investment. investment Any investment is made with the hope that these assets will earn profits.\n\nAt times, MNCs set up production jointly with some of the local companies of these countries. The benefit to the local company of such joint production is two-fold. First, MNCs can provide money for additional investments, like buying new machines for faster production. Second, MNCs might bring with them the latest technology for production.\n\n![](images/e934e64df24bf60f0688d9038d08037c066cff634e4674722f28cd72fe3244d5.jpg)  \nWEWILLSHIFT THIS FACTORY TO ER COUNTRY. S BECOME SIVE HERE!\n\nBut the most common route for MNC investments is to buy up local companies and then to expand production. MNCs with huge wealth can quite easily do so. To take an example, Cargill Foods, a very large American MNC,has bought over smaller Indian companies such as Parakh Foods.Parakh Foods had built a large marketing network in various parts of India,where its brand was well-reputed.Also,Parakh Foods had four oil refineries,whose control has now shifted to Cargill. Cargill is now the largest producer of edible oil in India, with a capacity to make 5 million pouches daily!\n\nIn fact, many of the top MNCs have wealth exceeding the entire budgets of the developing country governments. With such enormous wealth, imagine the power and influence of these MNCs!\n\nThere’s another way in which MNCs control production. Large MNCs in developed countries place orders for production with small producers. Garments, footwear, sports items are examples of industries where production is carried out by a large number of small producers around the world.\n\n![](images/fabf0b1fe3645e9c3eed6a175b16945b5fb2d7ecd2461cef83a3d7a3b2a7c9ac.jpg)  \nWomen at home in Ludhiana making footballs for large MNCs\n\n![](images/d917b888a0bea8e4350f4d2e1389d72c294aaea8792da1dbc7c7f8c618c3f19b.jpg)  \nJeans produced in developing countries being sold in USA forRs 6500 ($145)\n\nThe products are supplied to the MNCs, which then sell these under their own brand names to the customers. These large MNCs have tremendous power to determine price, quality, delivery, and labour conditions for these distant producers.\n\nThus, we see that there are a variety of ways in which the MNCs are spreading their production and interacting with local producers in various countries across the globe. By setting up partnerships with local companies, by using the local companies for supplies, by closely competing with the local companies or buying them up, MNCs are exerting a strong influence on production at these distant locations. As a result, production in these widely dispersed locations is getting interlinked.interlinked.",

This was done in collaboration with Mahindra and Mahindra, a major Indian manufacturer ofjeeps and trucks. By the year 2017, Ford Motors was selling 88,000 cars in the Indian markets, while another 1,81,000 cars were exported from India to South Africa, Mexico, Brazil and United States of America. The company wants to develop Ford India as a component supplying base for its other plants across the globe.\n\nRead the passage on the left and answer the questions.\n\n1. Would you say Ford Motors is a MNC? Why?   \n2. What is foreign investment? How much did Ford Motors invest in India?   \n3. By setting up their production plants in India, MNCs such as Ford Motors tap the advantage not only of the large markets that countries such as India provide, but also the lower costs of production. Explain the statement.   \n4. Why do you think the company wants to develop India as a base for manufacturing car components for its global operations? Discuss the following factors:\n\n(a) cost of labour and other resources in India   \n(b) the presence of several local manufacturers who supply autoparts to Ford Motors   \n(c) closeness to a large number of buyers in India and China\n\n5. In what ways will the production of cars by Ford Motors in India lead to interlinking of production?   \n6. In what ways is a MNC different from other companies?   \n7. Nearly all major multinationals are American, Japanese or European, such as Nike, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Honda, Nokia. Can you guess why?\n\n![](images/f0e2976363eafc95bc9355e1a5942ea038addf230c598fcb5d04ed21b115d33e.jpg)",

In history you would have read about the trade routes connecting India and South Asia to markets both in the East and West and the extensive trade that took place along these routes. Also, you would remember that it was trading interests which attracted various trading companies such as the East India Company to India. What then is the basic function of foreign trade?\n\nTo put it simply, foreign trade creates an opportunity for the producers to reach beyond the domestic markets, i.e., markets of their own countries. Producers can sell their produce not only in markets located within the country but can also compete in markets located in other countries of the world. Similarly, for the buyers, import of goods produced in another country is one way of expanding the choice of goods beyond what is domestically produced.\n\n![](images/7c2d47073b4fd0471fcecf311d9f3a112497840b5a6f8e35cddfd2ec592ba463.jpg)\n\nLet us see the effect of foreign trade tet ush the example of Chinese toys in the Indian markets.",

Buyers in India now have the option of choosing between Indian and the Chinese toys. Because of the cheaper prices and new designs, Chinese toys become more popular in the Indian markets. Within a year, 70 to 80 per cent of the toy shops have replaced Indian toys with Chinese toys. Toys are now cheaper in the Indian markets than earlier.\n\nWhat is happening here? As a result of trade, Chinese toys come into the Indian markets. In the competition between Indian and Chinese toys, Chinese toys prove better. Indian buyers have a greater choice of toys and at lower prices. For the Chinese toy makers, this provides an opportunity to expand business. The opposite is true for Indian toy makers. They face losses, as their toysare selling much less.\n\n![](images/146548d0bebc02a05d05253d9ec08acf0f8c7367307549b8de20a36f55859ec6.jpg)\n\nIn general, with the opening of trade, goods travel from one market to another.

Those who wish to import these toys would have to pay tax on this. Because of the tax, buyers will have to pay a higher price on imported toys. Chinese toys will no longer be as cheap in the Indian markets and imports from China will automatically reduce. Indian toy-makers will prosper.\n\nTax on imports is an example of trade barrier. It barrier is called a barrier because some restriction has been set up. Governments can use trade barriers to increase or decrease (regulate) foreign trade and to decide what kinds of goods and how much of each, should come into the country.\n\nThe Indian government, after Independence, had put barriers to foreign trade and foreign investment. This was considered necessary to protect the producers within the country from foreign competition. Industries were just coming up in the 1950s and 1960s, and competition from imports at that stage would not have allowed these industries to come up. Thus, India allowed imports of only essential items such as\n\nmachinery, fertilisers, petroleum etc. Note that all developed countries, during the early stages of development, have given protection to domestic producers through a variety of means.\n\nStarting around 1991, some farreaching changes in policy were made in India. The government decided that the time had come for Indian producers to compete with producers around the globe. It felt that competition would improve the performance of producers within the country since they would have to improve their quality. This decision was supported by powerful international organisations.\n\nThus, barriers on foreign trade and foreign investment were removed to a large extent. This meant that goods could be imported and exported easily and also foreign companies could set up factories and offices here.\n\nRemoving barriers or restrictions set by the government is what is known as liberalisation.known liberalisation. With liberalisation of trade, businesses are allowed to make decisions freely about what they wish to import or export. The government imposes much less restrictions than before and is therefore said to be more liberal.",

These organisations say that all barriers to foreign trade and investment are harmful. There should be no barriers. Trade between countries should be ‘free’. All countries in the world should liberalise their policies.\n\nWorld Trade Organisation (WTO) is one such organisation whose aim is to liberalise international trade. Started at the initiative of the\n\ndeveloped countries, WTO establishes rules regarding international trade, and sees that these rules are obeyed. About 160 countries of the world are currently members of the WTO.\n\nThough WTO is supposed to allow free trade for all, in practice, it is seen that the developed countries have unfairly retained trade barriers. On the other hand, WTO rules have forced the developing countries to remove trade barriers. An example of this is the current debate on trade in agricultural products.",

Let us look at some of the evidence.\n\nGlobalisation and greater competition among producers - both local and foreign producers - has been of advantage to consumers, particularly the well-off sections in the urban areas. There is greater choice before these consumers who now enjoy improved quality and lower prices for several products. As a result, these people today, enjoy much higher standards of living than was possible earlier.\n\nAmong producers and workers, the impact of globalisation has not been uniform.\n\nFirstly, MNCs have increased theirMNCs investments in India over the past 20 years, which means investing in India has been beneficial for them. MNCs have been interested in industries such as cell phones, automobiles, electronics, soft drinks, fast food or services such as banking in urban areas. These products have a large number of well-off buyers. In these industries and services, new jobs have been created. Also, local companies supplying raw materials, etc. to these industries have prospered.\n\n![](images/ee7f6bf621e2ec2d05a3123a3a033813dec11f51818486f2a89d841a10423006.jpg)",

    "text": "In recent years, the central and state governments in India are taking special steps to attract foreign companies to invest in India. Industrial zones, called Special Economic Zones (SEZs), are being set up. SEZs are to have world class facilities: electricity, water, roads, transport, storage, recreational and educational facilities. Companies who set up production units in the SEZs do not have to pay taxes for an initial period of five years.\n\nGovernment has also allowed flexibility in flexibility the labour laws to attract foreign investment. You have seen in Chapter 2 that the companies in the organised sector have to obey certain rules that aim to protect the workers’\n\nrights. In the recent years, the government has allowed companies to ignore many of these. Instead of hiring workers on a regular basis, companies hire workers ‘flexibly’ for short periods when there is intense pressure of work. This is done to reduce the cost of labour for the company. However, still not satisfied, foreign companies are demanding more flexibility in labour laws.\n\n![](images/f45fde966ae4cee9f1aa3a68cd256a750f2bd1ef988f8e1341d959009ed94ebd.jpg)\n\nSecondly, several of the top Indian companies companies have been able to benefit from the increased competition. They have invested in newer technology and production methods and raised their production standards. Some have gained from successful collaborations with foreign companies.\n\nMoreover, globalisation has enabled some large Indian companies to emerge as multinationals themselves! Tata Motors (auto-mobiles), Infosys (IT), Ranbaxy (medicines), Asian Paints (paints), Sundaram Fasteners (nuts and bolts) are some Indian companies\n\nwhich are spreading their operations worldwide.\n\nGlobalisation has also created new opportunities for companies providing services, particularly those involving IT. The Indian company producing a magazine for the London based company and call centres are some examples. Besides, a host of services such as data entry, account-ing, administrative tasks, engineering are now being done cheaply in countries such as India and are exported to the developed countries.",

Fair globalisation would create opportunities for all, and also ensure that the benefits of globalisation are shared better.\n\nThe government can play a major role in making this possible. Its policies must protect the interests, not only of the rich and the powerful, but all the people in the country. You have read about some of the possible steps that the government can take. For instance, the government can\n\nensure that labour laws are properly implemented and the workers get their rights. It can support small producers to improve their performance till the time they become strong enough to compete. If necessary, the government can use trade and investment barriers. It can negotiate at the WTO for ‘fairer rules’. It can also align with other developing countries with similar interests to fight against the domination of developed countries in the WTO.\n\nIn the past few years, massive campaigns and representation by people’s organisations have influenced important decisions relating to trade and investments at the WTO. This has demonstrated that people also can play an important role in the struggle for fair globalisation.\n\n![](images/c466afe533438bc6041dc48da10abfcdb7c6f39e90ba519c92fd245a58ea655a.jpg)  \nA demonstration against WTO in Hong Kong, 2005",

This is happening through greater foreign trade and foreign investment. MNCs are playing a major role in the globalisation process. More and more MNCs are looking for locations around the world that are cheap for their production. As a result, production is being organised in complex ways.\n\nTechnology, particularly IT, has played a big role in organising production across countries. In addition, liberalisation of trade and\n\ninvestment has facilitated globalisation by removing barriers to trade and investment. At the inter-national level, WTO has put pressure on developing coun-tries to liberalise trade and investment.\n\nWhile globalisation has benefited well-off consumers and also producers with skill, education and wealth, many small producers and workers have suffered as a result of the rising competition. Fair globalisation would create opportunities for all, and also ensure that the benefits of globalisation are shared better.",

There are many aspects of unequal situations in a market and poor enforcement of rules and regulations. Hence, there is a need to sensitise learners and encourage them to participate in the consumer movement. This chapter provides case histories how some consumers were exploited in real life situation and how legal institutions helped consumers in getting compensated and in upholding their rights. The case histories would enable the students to link these narratives to their life experiences. We have to enable students to understand that the awareness of being a well-informed consumer arose out of consumer movement and active participation of people through their struggles over a long period. This chapter also provides details of a few organisations helping consumers in different ways. Finally, it ends with some critical issues of the consumer movement in India.",

    "text": "This chapter has questions, case studies and activities. It would be preferred that students discuss these in groups orally. Some of these could be answered in writing individually.\n\nWhile carrying out each activity you could start with a brainstorming session about the activity. Similarly, there are many opportunities for roleplay in this chapter and this could be a useful way to share their experiences and understand the issues at a deeper level. Making\n\nposters collectively is another way to think about these issues. This lesson contains activities, which require visits — visit to consumer protection councils, consumer organisations, District/State/National level Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions, retail shops, marketplaces, etc. Organise the visits to maximise learners’ experience. Have a discussion with them about the purpose of the visit, things they need to do beforehand and things that need to be collected and the task (report/ project / article, etc.) they would carry out after the visit. As part of this chapter, the learners may do letter-writing and speaking activities. We may have to be sensitive to the language aspect of exercises.\n\nThis chapter contains material collected from authenticated websites, books, newspapers and magazines. For example, https://consumer affairs.nic.in is a website of Central Government Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution. Another website www. cutsinternational.org is the website of a consumer organisation working in India for 40 years. It publishes a variety of material to create consumer awareness in India. They need to be shared among learners so that they can also collect material as part of their activities. For example, case histories were taken from newspaper clippings and consumers who fought in Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions. Let learners collect and read such material from different sources: consumer protection councils, Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions and internet.\n\n![](images/b1377c9fc9b2805f5f4754bb7b710a9b808bb01ce7a64c7c3a361b57cf103649.jpg)\n\n1070CH05",

    "text": "We participate in the market both as producers and consumers. As producers of goods and services we could be working in any of the sectors discussed earlier such as agriculture, industry, or services. Consumers participate in the market when they purchase goods and services that they need. These are the final goods that people as consumers use.\n\nIn the preceding chapters we discussed the need for rules and regulations or steps that would promote development. These could be for the protection of workers in the unorganised sector or to protect people from high interest rates charged by moneylenders in the informal sector. Similarly, rules and regulations are also required for protecting the environment.\n\nFor example, moneylenders in the informal sector that you read about in Chapter 3 adopt various tricks to bind the borrower: they could make the producer sell the produce to them at a low rate in return for a timely loan; they could force a small farmer like Swapna to sell her land to pay back the loan. Similarly, many people who work in the unorganised sector have to work at a low wage and accept conditions that are not fair and are also often harmful to their health. To prevent such exploitation, we have talked of rules and regulations for their protection. There are organisations that have struggled for long to ensure that these rules are 11\n\nLikewise, rules and regulations are required for the protection of the consumers in the marketplace. Individual consumers often find themselves in a weak position. Whenever there is a complaint regarding a good or service that had been bought, the seller tries to shift all the responsibility on to the buyer. Their position usually is – “If you didn’t like what you bought, please go elsewhere”. As if the seller has no responsibility once a sale is completed! The consumer movement, as we shall discuss later, is an effort to change this situation.\n\nExploitation in the marketplace happens in various ways. For example, sometimes traders indulge in unfair trade practices such as when shopkeepers weigh less than what they should or when traders add charges that were not mentioned before, or when adulterated/defective goods are sold.\n\nMarkets do not work in a fair manner when producers are few and powerful whereas consumers purchase in small amounts and are scattered. This happens especially when large companies are producing these goods. These companies with huge wealth, power and reach can manipulate the market in various ways. At times false information is passed on through the media, and other sources to attract consumers. For example, a company for years sold powder milk for babies all over\n\n![](images/96f1fa092915a63dfffdb79656b1493bf9f58ca319411e6737aa011fc50a3d47.jpg)",

    "text": "The consumer movement arose out of dissatisfaction of the consumers as many unfair practices were being indulged in by the sellers. There was no legal system available to consumers to protect them from exploitation in the marketplace. For a long time, when a consumer was not happy with a particular brand product or shop, he or she generally avoided buying that brand product, or would stop purchasing from that shop. It was presumed that it was the responsibility of consumers to be careful while buying a commodity or service. It took many years for organisations in India, and around the world, to create awareness amongst people. This has also shifted the responsibility of ensuring\n\nquality of goods and services on the sellers.\n\nIn India, the consumer movement as a ‘social force’ originated with the necessity of protecting and promoting the interests of consumers against unethical and unfair trade practices. Rampant food shortages, hoarding, black marketing, adulteration of food and edible oil gave birth to the consumer movement in an organised form in the 1960s. Till the 1970s, consumer organisations were largely engaged in writing articles and holding exhibitions. They formed consumer groups to look into the malpractices in ration shops and overcrowding in the road passenger transport. More recently, India witnessed an upsurge in the number of consumer groups.",

While using many goods and services, we as consumers, have the right to be protected against the marketing of goods and delivery of services that are hazardous to life and property. Producers need to strictly follow the required safety rules and regulations. There are many goods and services that we purchase that require special attention to safety. For example, pressure cookers have a safety valve which, if it is defective, can cause a serious accident. The manufacturers of the safety valve have to ensure high quality. You also need public or government action to see that this quality is maintained. However, we do find bad quality products in the market because the supervision of these rules is weak and the consumer movement is also not strong enough.",

These details are about ingredients used, price, batch number, date of manufacture, expiry date and the address of the manufacturer. When we buy medicines, on the packets, you might find ‘directions for proper use’ and information relating to side effects and risks associated with usage of that medicine. When you buy garments, you will find information on ‘instructions for washing’.\n\nWhy is it that rules have been made so that the manufacturer displays this information? It is because consumers have the right to be informed aboutinformed the particulars of goods and services that they purchase. Consumers can then complain and ask for compensation or replacement if the product proves to be defective in any manner. For example, if we buy a\n\nproduct and find it defective well within the expiry period, we can ask for a replacement. If the expiry period was not printed, the manufacturer would blame the shopkeeper and will not accept the responsibility. If people sell medicines that have expired severe action can be taken against them. Similarly, one can protest and complain if someone sells a good at more than the printed price on the packet. This is indicated by ‘MRP’ — maximum retail price. In fact consumers can bargain with the seller to sell at less than the MRP.\n\nIn recent times, the right to information has been expanded to cover various services provided by the Government. In October 2005, the Government of India enacted a law, popularly known as RTI (Right to Information) Act, which ensures its citizens all the information about the functions of government departments. The effect of the RTI Act can be understood from the following case.\n\n![](images/0d3c6b8e0b276447d51f26bd52efe8cfcb40a9804063c345e2744f03c058ecc2.jpg)",

The State Commission upheld the District Commission's direction and further fined the institute Rs 25,000 for a frivolous appeal. It also directed the institute to pay\n\nRs 7ooo as compensation and litigation cost.\n\nThe State Commission also restrained all the educational and professional institutions in the state fromcharging fees from students for the entire duration of the course in advance and that too at one go.

If you are not interested in buying the brush, your right to choice is denied. Similarly, sometimes gas supply dealers insist that you have to buy the stove from them when you take a new connection. In this way many a times you are forced to buy things that you may not wish to and you are left with no choice.",

THE JUDGE ANNOUNCES COMMISSION VERDICT.\n\nThe consumer movement in India has led to the formation of various organisations, locally known as consumer forums or consumer protection councils. They guide consumers on how to file cases in the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions. On many occasions, they also represent individual consumers in these commissions. These voluntary organisations also receive financial support from the government for creating awareness among people.\n\nIf you are living in a residential colony, you might have noticed boards of Residents’ Welfare Associations. If there is any unfair trade practice meted out to their members, they take up the case on their behalf.\n\nUnder COPRA, a three-tier quasijudicial machinery at the district, state\n\nand national levels was set up for redressal of consumer disputes. The district-level authority called District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission deals with the cases involving claims up to Rs 1 crore, the state-level Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions called State Commission between Rs 1 crore and Rs 10 crore and the national-level commission — National Commission — deals with cases involving claims exceeding Rs 10 crore. If a case is dismissed in district-level commission, a consumer can also appeal in the state and then in national-level commissions.\n\nThus, the Act has enabled us as consumers to have the right to represent in represent the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions.\n\n![](images/72ea55022a9e69067ec21c1ef87b73abf6c1533f8774ded5ff41216c3e42b0dd.jpg)",

India is one of the countries that have exclusive authority for consumer redressal.\n\nThe consumer movement in India has made some progress in terms of numbers of organised groups and\n\ntheir activities. There are today more than 2000 consumer groups in the country of which only about 50-60 are well organised and recognised for their work.\n\nHowever, the consumer redressal process is becoming cumbersome, expensive and time consuming.

Moreover most purchases in the market are small retail sales. The COPRA was amended in the year 2019 to further strengthen consumers in India. Buying through internet is now included. If there is any service deficiency or defective product, service provider or manufacturer is also held responsible and would be penalized or even imprisoned. Settlement of disputes with the help of a neutral intermediary outside the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, called mediator, is now\n\nencouraged at all the three tiers Consumer Commissions. After more than 30 years of the enactment of COPRA, consumer awareness in India is spreading but slowly. Besides this the enforcement of laws that protect workers, especially in the unorganised sectors is weak. Similarly, rules and regulations for working of markets are often not followed.\n\nNevertheless, there is scope for consumers to realise their role and importance. It is often said that consumer movements can be effective only with the consumers’ active involvement. It requires a voluntary effort and struggle involving the participation of one and all.",

As a result, human beings used them indiscriminately and this has led to the following major problems.\n\n• Depletion of resources for satisfying the greed of a few individuals.   \n• Accumulation of resources in few hands, which, in turn, divided the society into two segments i.e. haves and have nots or rich and poor.   \n• Indiscriminate exploitation of resources has led to global ecological crises such as, global warming, ozone layer depletion, environmental pollution and land degradation.\n\n## \n\n1. Imagine, if the oil supply gets exhausted one day, how would this affect our life style?   \n2. Plan a survey in your colony/village to investigate people’s attitude towards recycling of the domestic/agricultural wastes. Ask questions about :\n\n(a) What do they think about resources they use?   \n(b) What is their opinion about the wastes, and its utilisation?   \n(c) Collage your results.\n\nAn equitable distribution of resources has become essential for a sustained quality of life and global peace. If the present trend of resource depletion by a few individuals and countries continues, the future of our planet is in danger.\n\nTherefore, resource planning is essential for sustainable existence of all forms of life.

There are many regions in our country that are rich in resources but these are included in economically backward regions. On the contrary there are some regions which have a poor resource base but they are economically developed.\n\nCan you name some resource rich but economically backward regions and some resource poor but economically developed regions? Give reasons for such a situation.\n\nThe history of colonisation reveals that rich resources in colonies were the main attractions for the foreign invaders. It was primarily the higher level of technological development of the colonising countries that helped them to exploit resources of other regions and establish their supremacy over the colonies. Therefore, resources can contribute to development only when they are accompanied by appropriate technological development and institutional changes. India has experienced all this in different phases of colonisation. Therefore, in India, development, in general, and resource development in particular does not only involve the availability of resources, but also the technology, quality of human resources and the historical experiences of the people.\n\nConservation of Resources: Resources are vital for any developmental activity. But irrational consumption and over-utilisation of resources may lead to socio-economic and environmental problems. To overcome these problems, resource conservation at various levels is important. This had been the main concern of the leaders and thinkers in the past. For example, Gandhiji was very apt in voicing his concern about resource conservation in these words: “There is enough\n\nfor everybody’s need and not for any body’s greed.” He placed the greedy and selfish individuals and exploitative nature of modern technology as the root cause for resource depletion at the global level. He was against mass production and wanted to replace it with the production by the masses.\n\nAt the international level, the Club of Rome advocated resource conservation for the first time in a more systematic way in 1968. Subsequently, in 1974, Gandhian philosophy was once again presented by Schumacher in his book Small is Beautiful. The seminal contribution with respect to resource conservation at the global level was made by the Brundtland Commission Report, 1987. This report introduced the concept of ‘Sustainable Development’ and advocated it as a means for resource conservation, which was subsequently published in a book entitled Our Common Future. Another significant contribution was made at the Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992.",

Ninety-five per cent of our basic needs for food, shelter and clothing are obtained from land. Human activities have not only brought about degradation of land but have also aggravated the pace of natural forces to cause damage to land.\n\nSome human activities such as deforestation, over grazing, mining and quarrying too have contributed significantly in land degradation.\n\nMining sites are abandoned after excavation work is complete leaving deep scars and traces of over-burdening. In states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha deforestation due to mining have caused severe land degradation. In states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra overgrazing is one of the main reasons for land degradation. In the states of Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh, over irrigation is responsible for land degradation due to water logging leading to increase in salinity and alkalinity in the soil. The mineral processing like grinding of limestone for cement industry and calcite and soapstone for ceramic industry generate huge quantity of dust in the atmosphere. It retards the process of infiltration of water into the soil after it settles down on the land. In recent years, industrial effluents as waste have become a major source of land and water bec pol pollution in many parts of the country.\n\nThere are many ways to solve the problems of land degradation. Afforestation and proper management of grazing can help to some extent. Planting of shelter belts of plants, control on over grazing, stabilisation of sand dunes by growing thorny bushes are some of the methods to check land degradation in arid areas. Proper management of waste lands, control of mining activities, proper discharge and disposal of industrial effluents and wastes after treatment can reduce land and water degradation in industrial and suburban areas.",

The processes of soil formation and erosion, go on simultaneously and generally there is a balance between the two. Sometimes, this balance is disturbed due to human activities like deforestation, over-grazing, construction and mining etc., while natural forces like wind, glacier and water lead to soil erosion. The running water cuts through the clayey soils and makes deep channels as gullies. The land becomes unfit for cultivation and is known as bad land. In the Chambal basin such lands are called ravines. Sometimes water flows as a sheet over large areas down a slope. In such cases the top soil is washed away. This is known as sheet erosion. Wind blows loose soil off flat or sloping land known as wind erosion. Soil erosion is also caused due to defective methods of farming.

This is called contour ploughing. Steps can be cut out on the slopes making terraces. Terrace cultivation restricts erosion. Western and central Himalayas have well developed terrace farming. Large fields can be divided into strips. Strips of grass are left to grow between the crops. This breaks up the force of the wind. This method is known as strip cropping. Planting lines of trees to create shelter also works in a similar way. Rows of such trees are called shelter belts. These shelter belts have contributed significantly to the stabilisation of sand dunes and in stabilising the desert in western India.\n\n1 .

Conservation preserves the ecological diversity and our life support systems – water, air and soil. It also preserves the genetic diversity of plants and animals for better growth of species and breeding. For example, in agriculture, we are still dependent on traditional crop varieties. Fisheries too are heavily dependent on the maintenance of aquatic biodiversity.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, conservationists demanded a national wildlife protection\n\n![](images/2615f501327a58894b452b5a1873f0c3ad6303b83857f34c3799cc4b9075af09.jpg)  \nTribal girls using bamboo saplings in a nursery at Mukhali near Silent Valley\n\n![](images/e9e85da737f5e2267aada39c4f8c3d60df4eb2cce10306e1822ef2b4a2e3071b.jpg)  \nLeaf litter collection by women folk\n\n![](images/767a9b0cc409dcd0a0dcdd8c4ea658a8159cfc9b81df794dce074c7914a456a8.jpg)  \nTribal women selling minor forest produce   \nFig. 2.1\n\nprogramme. The Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act was implemented in 1972, with various provisions for protecting habitats. An all-India list of protected species was also published. The thrust of the programme was towards protecting the remaining population of certain endangered species by banning hunting, giving legal protection to their habitats, and restricting trade in wildlife. Subsequently, central and many state governments established national parks and wildlife sanctuaries about which you have already studied. The central government also announced several projects for protecting specific animals, which were gravely threatened, including the tiger, the onehorned rhinoceros, the Kashmir stag or hangul, three types of crocodiles - fresh water crocodile, saltwater crocodile and the Gharial, the Asiatic lion, and others. Most recently, the Indian elephant, black buck (chinkara), the great Indian bustard (godawan) and the snow leopard, etc. have been given full or partial legal protection against hunting and trade throughout India.",

In 1973, the authorities realised that the tiger population had dwindled to 1,827 from an estimated 55,000 at the turn of the century. The major threats to tiger population are numerous, such as poaching for trade, shrinking habitat, depletion of prey base species, growing human population, etc. The trade of tiger skins and the use of their bones in traditional medicines, especially in the Asian countries left the tiger population on the verge of extinction. Since India and Nepal provide habitat to about two-thirds of the surviving tiger population in the world, these two nations became prime targets for poaching and illegal trading.\n\n“Project Tiger”, one of the wellpublicised wildlife campaigns in the world, was launched in 1973. Tiger conservation has been viewed not only as an effort to save an endangered species, but with\n\n![](images/ad94d2ba11e94bbbabce893f2786cda31b5fc1d0555307283167781bcbac0c30.jpg)\n\n![](images/4f09c831e14f0ede98157d0f866b48e07ecd2dba15252a02974a6ed24ba372bb.jpg)  \nFIg. 2.2: Rhino and deer in Kaziranga National Park\n\nequal importance as a means of preserving biotypes of sizeable magnitude. Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand, Sunderbans National Park in West Bengal, Bandhavgarh National Park in Madhya Pradesh, Sariska Wildlife Sanctuary in Rajasthan, Manas Tiger Reserve in Assam and Periyar Tiger Reserve in Kerala are some of the tiger reserves of India.\n\nThe conservation projects are now focusing on biodiversity rather than on a few of its components. There is now a more intensive search for different conservation measures. Increasingly, even insects are beginning to find a place in conservation planning. In the notification under Wildlife Act of 1980 and 1986, several hundred butterflies, moths, beetles, and one dragonfly have been added to the list of protected species. In 1991, for the first time plants were also added to the list, starting with six species.\n\n## \n\nCollect more information on the wildlife sanctuaries and national parks of India and cite their locations on the map of India.",

In some areas of India, local communities are struggling to conserve these habitats along with government officials, recognising that only this will secure their own long-term livelihood. In Sariska Tiger Reserve, Rajasthan, villagers have fought against mining by citing the Wildlife Protection Act. In many areas, villagers themselves are protecting habitats and explicitly rejecting government involvement. The inhabitants of five villages in the Alwar district of Rajasthan have declared 1,200 hectares of forest as the Bhairodev\n\nDakav ‘Sonchuri’, declaring their own set of rules and regulations which do not allow hunting, and are protecting the wildlife against any outside encroachments.\n\nThe famous Chipko movement in theChipko Himalayas has not only successfully resisted deforestation in several areas but has also shown that community afforestation with indigenous species can be enormously successful. Attempts to revive the traditional conservation methods or developing new methods of ecological farming are now widespread. Farmers and citizen’s groups like the Beej Bachao Andolan Andolan in Tehri and Navdanya Navdanya have shown that adequate levels of diversified crop production without the use of synthetic chemicals are possible and economically viable.\n\nIn India joint forest management (JFM) programme furnishes a good example for involving local communities in the",

    "text": "Nature worship is an age old tribal belief based on the premise that all creations of nature have to be protected. Such beliefs have preserved several virgin forests in pristine form called Sacred Groves (the forests of God and Goddesses). These patches of forest or parts of large forests have been left untouched by the local people and any interference with them is banned.\n\nCertain societies revere a particular tree which they have preserved from time immemorial. The Mundas and the Santhal of Chota Nagpur region worship mahua (Bassia latifolia) and kadamba (Anthocaphalus cadamba) trees, and the tribals of Odisha and Bihar worship the tamarind (Tamarindus indica) and mango (Mangifera indica) trees during weddings. To many of us, peepal and banyan trees are considered sacred.\n\nIndian society comprises several cultures, each with its own set of traditional methods of conserving nature and its creations. Sacred qualities are often ascribed to springs, mountain peaks, plants and animals which are closely protected. You will find troops of macaques and langurs around many temples. They are fed daily and treated as a part of temple devotees. In and around Bishnoi villages in Rajasthan, herds of blackbuck, (chinkara), nilgai and peacocks can be seen as an integral part of the community and nobody harms them.\n\nmanagement and restoration of degraded forests. The programme has been in formal existence since 1988 when the state of Odisha passed the first resolution for joint forest management. JFM depends on the formation of local (village) institutions that undertake protection activities mostly on degraded forest land managed by the forest department. In return, the members of these communities are entitled to intermediary benefits like non-timber forest produces and share in the timber harvested by ‘successful protection’.\n\nThe clear lesson from the dynamics of both environmental destruction and reconstruction in India is that local communities everywhere have to be involved in some kind of natural resource management. But there is still a long way to go before local communities are at the centre-stage in decision-making. Accept only those economic or developmental activities, that are people centric, environment-friendly and economically rewarding.",

True, the availability of water resources varies over space and time, mainly due to the variations in seasonal and annual precipitation, but water scarcity in most cases\n\nis caused by over-exploitation, excessive use and unequal access to water among different social groups.\n\nWhere is then water scarcity likely to occur? As you have read in the hydrological cycle, freshwater can be obtained directly from precipitation, surface run off and groundwater.\n\nIs it possible that an area or region may have ample water resources but is still facing water scarcity? Many of our cities are such examples. Thus, water scarcity may be an outcome of large and growing population and\n\nconsequent greater demands for water, and unequal access to it. A large population requires more water not only for domestic use but also to produce more food. Hence, to facilitate higher food-grain production, water resources are being over-exploited to expand irrigated areas for dry-season agriculture. Irrigated agriculture is the largest consumer of water. Now it is needed to revolutionise the agriculture through developing drought resistant crops and dry farming techniques. You may have seen in many television advertisements that most farmers have their\n\n![](images/1fbd0a1c8c25029a86be0275eb599401ef1f42ddf97c1db586766c726782b59b.jpg)  \nWater, Water Everywhere, Not a Drop to Drink: After a heavy downpour, a boy collects drinking water in Kolkata.

    "text": "Post-independent India witnessed intensive industrialisation and urbanisation, creating vast opportunities for us. Today, large industrial houses are as commonplace as the industrial units of many MNCs (Multinational Corporations). The ever-increasing number of industries has made matters worse by exerting pressure on existing freshwater resources. Industries, apart from being heavy users of water, also require power to run them. Much of this energy comes from hydroelectric power. Today, in India hydroeclectric power contributes approximately 22 per cent of the total electricity produced. Moreover, multiplying urban centres with large and dense populations and urban lifestyles have not only added to water and energy requirements but have further aggravated the problem. If you look into the housing societies or colonies in the cities, you would find that most of these have their own groundwater pumping devices to meet their water needs. Not surprisingly, we find that fragile water resources are being over-exploited and have caused their depletion in several of these cities.\n\nSo far we have focused on the quantitative aspects of water scarcity. Now, let us consider another situation where water is sufficiently available to meet the needs of the people, but, the area still suffers from water scarcity. This scarcity may be due to bad quality of water. Lately, there has been a growing concern that even if there is ample water to meet the needs of the people, much of it may be polluted by domestic and industrial wastes, chemicals, pesticides and fertilisers used in agriculture, thus, making it hazardous for human use. Government of India has accorded highest priority to improve the quality of life and enhance ease of living of people especially those living in rual areas by announcing the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM). The Goal of JJM is to enable every rural household get assured supply of potable piped water at a service level of 55 litres per capita per day regularly on\n\nlong-term basis by ensuring functionality of the tap water connections. (Source: Economic Survey 2020–21, p.357)\n\nIndia’s rivers, especially the smaller ones, have all turned into toxic streams. And even the big ones like the Ganga and Yamuna are far from being pure. The assault on India’s rivers – from population growth, agricultural modernisation, urbanisation and industrialisation – is enormous and growing by the day….. This entire life stands threatened.\n\nSource: The Citizens'Fifth Report, CSE, 1999.\n\nYou may have already realised that the need of the hour is to conserve and manage our water resources, to safeguard ourselves from health hazards, to ensure food security, continuation of our livelihoods and productive activities and also to prevent degradation of our natural ecosystems. Over exploitation and mismanagement of water resources will impoverish this resource and cause ecological crisis that may have profound impact on our lives.\n\n## \n\nFrom your everyday experiences, write a short proposal on how you can conserve water.",

Dams were traditionally built to impound rivers and rainwater that could be used later to irrigate agricultural fields. Today, dams are built not just for irrigation but for electricity generation, water supply for domestic and industrial uses, flood control, recreation, inland navigation and fish breeding. Hence, dams are now referred to as multi-purpose projects where the many uses of the impounded water are integrated with one another. For example, in the Sutluj-Beas river basin, the Bhakra – Nangal project water is being used both for hydel power production and irrigation. Similarly, the Hirakud project in the Mahanadi basin integrates conservation of water with flood control.\n\nMulti-purpose projects, launched after Independence with their integrated water resources management approach, were thought of as the vehicle that would lead the nation to development and progress, overcoming the\n\nA dam is a barrier across flowing water that obstructs, directs or retards the flow, often creating a reservoir, lake or impoundment. “Dam” refers to the reservoir rather than the structure. Most dams have a section called a spillway or weir over which or through which it is intended that water will flow either intermittently or continuously. Dams are classified according to structure, intended purpose or height. Based on structure and the materials used, dams are classified as timber dams, embankment dams or masonry dams, with several subtypes. According to the height, dams can be categorised as large dams and major dams or alternatively as low dams, medium height dams and high dams.\n\nhandicap of its colonial past.

    "text": "In recent years, multi-purpose projects and large dams have come under great scrutiny and opposition for a variety of reasons. Regulating and damming of rivers affect their natural flow causing poor sediment flow and excessive sedimentation at the bottom of the reservoir, resulting in rockier stream\n\nbeds and poorer habitats for the rivers’ aquatic life. Dams also fragment rivers making it difficult for aquatic fauna to migrate, especially for spawning. The reservoirs that are created on the floodplains also submerge the existing vegetation and soil leading to its decomposition over a period of time.\n\nMulti-purpose projects and large dams have also been the cause of many new environmental movements like the ‘Narmada Bachao Andolan’ and the ‘Tehri Dam Andolan’ etc. Resistance to these projects has primarily been due to the large-scale displacement of local communities. Local people often had to give up their land, livelihood and their meagre access and control over resources for the greater good of the nation. So, if the local people are not benefiting from such projects then who is benefited? Perhaps, the landowners and large farmers, industrialists and few urban centres. Take the case of the landless in a village – does he really gain from such a project?\n\nNarmada Bachao Andolan or Save Narmada Movement is a Non Governmental Organisation (NGO) that mobilised tribal people, farmers, environmentalists and human rights activists against the Sardar Sarovar Dam being built across the Narmada river in Gujarat. It originally focused on the environmental issues related to trees that would be submerged under the dam water. Recently it has re-focused the aim to enable poor citizens, especially the oustees (displaced people) to get full rehabilitation facilities from the government.\n\nPeople felt that their suffering would not be in vain… accepted the trauma of displacement believing in the promise of irrigated fields and plentiful harvests. So, often the survivors of Rihand told us that they accepted their sufferings as sacrifice for the sake of their nation. But now, after thirty bitter years of being adrift, their livelihood having even being more precarious, they keep asking: “Are we the only ones chosen to make sacrifices for the nation?”\n\nSource: S.

    "text": "Rooftop rainwater harvesting is the most common practice in Shillong, Meghalaya. It is interesting because Cherapunjee and Mawsynram situated at a distance of 55 km. from Shillong receive the highest rainfall in the world, yet the state capital Shillong faces acute shortage of water. Nearly every household in the city has a rooftop rainwater harvesting structure. Nearly 15-25 per cent of the total water requirement of the household comes from rooftop water harvesting.\n\n## \n\nFind out other rainwater harvesting systems existing in and around your locality.\n\nToday, in western Rajasthan, sadly the practice of rooftop rainwater harvesting is on the decline as plenty of water is available due to the perennial Indira Gandhi Canal, though some houses still maintain the tankas since they do not like the taste of tap water. Fortunately, in\n\nmany parts of rural and urban India, rooftop rainwater harvesting is being successfully adapted to store and conserve water. In Gendathur, a remote backward village in Mysuru, Karnataka, villagers have installed, in their household’s rooftop, rainwater harvesting system to meet their water needs. Nearly 200 households have installed this system and the village has earned the rare distinction of being rich in rainwater. See Fig. 3.6 for a better understanding of the rooftop rainwater harvesting system which is adapted here. Gendathur receives an annual precipitation of $1 , 0 0 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ , and with 80 per cent of collection efficiency and of about 10 fillings, every house can collect and use about 50,000 litres of water annually. From the 200 houses, the net amount of rainwater harvested annually amounts to 1,00,000 litres.\n\n![](images/248bf904e9e70bdf8795459dfbd8382892c080c057c41db602d6acffafdbd89a.jpg)  \nFig. 3.6\n\nRooftop harvesting was common across the towns and villages of the Thar. Rainwater that falls on the sloping roofs of houses is taken through a pipe into an underground tanka (circular holes in the ground). built in the main house or in the courtyard. The picture above shows water being taken from a neighbour’s roof through a long pipe. Here the neighbour’s rooftop has been used for collection of rainwater. The picture shows a hole through which rainwater flows down into an underground tanka.",

Primitive subsistence agriculture is practised on small patches of land with the help of primitive tools like hoe, dao and digging sticks, and family/community labour. This type of farming depends upon monsoon, natural fertility of the soil and suitability of other environmental conditions to the crops grown.\n\nIt is a ‘slash and burn’ agriculture. Farmers clear a patch of land and produce cereals and other food crops to sustain their family. When the soil fertility decreases, the farmers shift and clear a fresh patch of land for cultivation. This type of shifting allows Nature to replenish the fertility of the soil\n\nthrough natural processes; land productivity in this type of agriculture is low as the farmer does not use fertilisers or other modern inputs. It is known by different names in different parts of the country.\n\nCan you name some such types of farmings?\n\nIt is jhummingin north-eastern states like Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland; Pamlou in Manipur, Dipa in Bastar district of Chhattishgarh, and in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\nJhumming: The ‘slash and burn’ agriculture is known as ‘Milpa’ in Mexico and Central America, ‘Conuco’ in Venzuela, ‘Roca’ in Brazil, ‘Masole’ in Central Africa, ‘Ladang’ in Indonesia, ‘Ray’ in Vietnam.\n\nIn India, this primitive form of cultivation is called ‘Bewar’ or ‘Dahiya’ in Madhya Pradesh, ‘Podu’ or ‘Penda’ in Andhra Pradesh, ‘Pama Dabi’ or ‘Koman’ or Bringa’ in Odisha, ‘Kumari’ in Western Ghats, ‘Valre’ or ‘Waltre’ in South-eastern Rajasthan, ‘Khil’ in the Himalayan belt, ‘Kuruwa’ in Jharkhand, and ‘Jhumming’ in the North-eastern region.\n\n![](images/e6f7cd288493a2c4778c05fe10f1f5bbff2bd179d6482eb6ec3560a28eb40a2c.jpg)  \nFig. 4.1\n\nRinjha lived with her family in a small village at the outskirts of Diphu in Assam.

It is labourintensive farming, where high doses of biochemical inputs and irrigation are used for obtaining higher production.\n\nCan you name some of the states of India where such farming is practised?\n\nThough the ‘right of inheritance’ leading to the division of land among successive generations has rendered land-holding size uneconomical, the farmers continue to take maximum output from the limited land in the absence of alternative source of livelihood. Thus, there is enormous pressure on agricultural land.\n\nCommercial Farming",

In this type of farming, a single crop is grown on a large area. The plantation has an interface of agriculture and industry. Plantations cover large tracts of land, using capital intensive inputs, with the help of migrant labourers. All the produce is used as raw material in respective industries.\n\nIn India, tea, coffee, rubber, sugarcane, banana, etc., are important plantation crops. Tea in Assam and North Bengal coffee in Karnataka are some of the important plantation crops grown in these states. Since the production is mainly for market, a welldeveloped network of transport and communication connecting the plantation areas, processing industries and markets plays an important role in the development of plantations.\n\n![](images/9c5d43316c4213bf6b1a3fe4c70ad361b397743e591918b1f1462a94f0d50801.jpg)  \nFig. 4.2: Banana plantation in Southern part of India\n\n![](images/1e232cce10406e40dc2e61e80095d841cf08ceb0d0e781cf6dc5a0b6e317c0ab.jpg)  \nFig. 4.3: Bamboo plantation in North-east",

    "text": "You have studied the physical diversities and plurality of cultures in India. These are also reflected in agricultural practices and cropping patterns in the country. Various types of food and fibre crops, vegetables and fruits, spices and condiments, etc. constitute some of the important crops grown in the country. India has three cropping seasons — rabi, kharif and zaid.\n\nRabi crops are sown in winter from October to December and harvested in summer from April to June. Some of the important rabi crops are wheat, barley, peas, gram and mustard. Though, these crops are grown in large parts of India, states from the north and northwestern parts such as Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh are important for the production of wheat and other rabi crops. Availability of precipitation during winter months due to the western temperate cyclones helps in the success of these crops. However, the success of the green revolution in Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and parts of Rajasthan has also been an important factor in the growth of the abovementioned rabi crops.\n\nKharif crops are grown with the onset of monsoon in different parts of the country and these are harvested in September-October. Important crops grown during this season are paddy, maize, jowar, bajra, tur (arhar), moong, urad, cotton, jute, groundnut and soyabean. Some of the most important rice-growing regions are Assam, West Bengal, coastal regions of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Maharashtra, particularly the (Konkan coast) along with Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Recently, paddy has also become an important crop of Punjab and Haryana. In states like Assam, West Bengal and Odisha, three crops of paddy are grown in a year. These are Aus, Amanand Boro.\n\nIn between the rabi and the kharif seasons, there is a short season during the summer months known as the Zaid season. Some of the crops produced during ‘zaid’ are watermelon, muskmelon, cucumber,\n\nvegetables and fodder crops. Sugarcane takes almost a year to grow.",

Major crops grown in India are rice, wheat, millets, pulses, tea, coffee, sugarcane, oil seeds, cotton and jute, etc.\n\nRice: It is the staple food crop of a majority of the people in India. Our country is the second largest producer of rice in the world after China. It is a kharif crop which requires high temperature, (above $2 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ and high humidity with annual rainfall above $1 0 0 \\mathrm { c m } .$ . In the areas of less rainfall, it grows with the help of irrigation.\n\nRice is grown in the plains of north and north-eastern India, coastal areas and the deltaic regions.

It is the main food crop, in north and north-western part of the country. This rabi crop requires a cool growing season and a bright sunshine at the time of ripening. It requires 50 to 75 cm of annual rainfall evenlydistributed over the growing season. There are two important wheat-growing zones in the country – the Ganga-Satluj plains in the northwest and black soil region of the Deccan. The major wheat-producing states are Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan.\n\nMillets: Jowar, bajra and ragi are the important millets grown in India. Though,\n\n![](images/8e0a706099d2a27aa42e54b147acd486032a8ea07dc8089a556686ee066fd3d3.jpg)  \nFig. 4.5: Wheat Cultivation\n\nthese are known as coarse grains, they have very high nutritional value. For example, ragi is very rich in iron, calcium, other micro nutrients and roughage. Jowar is the third most important food crop with respect to area and production.

In rapeseed production India was third largest producer in the world after Canada and China in 2018. Different oil seeds are grown covering approximately 12 per cent of the total cropped area of the country. Main oil-seeds produced in India are groundnut, mustard, coconut, sesamum (til), soyabean, castor seeds, cotton seeds, linseed and sunflower. Most of these are edible and used as cooking mediums. However, some of these are also used as raw material in the production of soap, cosmetics and ointments.\n\nGroundnut is a kharif crop and accounts for about half of the major oilseeds produced in the country. Gujarat was the largest producer of groundnut followed by Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu in 2019–20. Linseed and mustard are rabi crops. Sesamum is a kharif crop in north and rabi crop in south India. Castor seed is grown both as rabi and kharif crop.\n\nTea: Tea cultivation is an example of plantation agriculture. It is also an important beverage crop introduced in India initially by the British. Today, most of the tea plantations are owned by Indians.

    "text": "It was mentioned in the previous pages that agriculture has been practised in India for thousands of years. Sustained uses of land without compatible techno-institutional changes have hindered the pace of agricultural development. Inspite of development of sources of irrigation most of the farmers in large parts of the country still depend upon monsoon and natural fertility in order to carry on their agriculture. For a growing population, this poses a serious challenge. Agriculture which provides livelihood for more than 60 per cent of its population, needs some serious technical and institutional reforms. Thus, collectivisation, consolidation of holdings, cooperation and abolition of zamindari, etc. were given priority to bring about institutional reforms in the country after Independence. ‘Land reform’ was the main focus of our First Five Year Plan. The right of inheritance had already lead to fragmentation of land holdings necessitating consolidation of holdings.\n\nThe laws of land reforms were enacted but the implementation was lacking or lukewarm. The Government of India embarked upon introducing agricultural reforms to improve Indian agriculture in the 1960s and 1970s. The Green Revolution based on the use of package technology and the White Revolution (Operation Flood) were some of the strategies initiated to improve the lot of Indian agriculture.

Once, when he was delivering a lecture at Pochampalli in Andhra Pradesh, some poor landless villagers demanded some land for their economic well-being. Vinoba Bhave could not promise it to them immediately but assured them to talk to the Government of India regarding provision of land for them if they undertook cooperative farming.\n\nSuddenly, Shri Ram Chandra Reddy stood up and offered 80 acres of land to be distributed among 80 land-less villagers. This act was known as ‘Bhoodan’. Later he travelled and introduced his ideas widely all over India. Some zamindars, owners of many villages offered to distribute some villages among the landless. It was known as Gramdan. However, many land-owners chose to provide some part of their land to the poor farmers due to the fear of land ceiling act. This Bhoodan-Gramdan movement initiated by Vinoba Bhave is also known as the Blood-less Revolution.\n\n1 .

    "text": "Minerals are usually found in “ores”. The term ore is used to describe an accumulation of any mineral mixed with other elements. The mineral content of the ore must be in\n\nsufficient concentration to make its extraction commercially viable. The type of formation or structure in which they are found determines the relative ease with which mineral ores may be mined. This also determines the cost of extraction. It is, therefore, important for us to understand the main types of formations in which minerals occur.\n\nMinerals generally occur in these forms:\n\n(i) In igneous and metamorphic rocks minerals may occur in the cracks, crevices, faults or joints. The smaller occurrences are called veins and the larger are called lodes. In most cases, they are formed when minerals in liquid/ molten and gaseous forms are forced upward through cavities towards the earth’s surface. They cool and solidify as they rise. Major metallic minerals like tin, copper, zinc and lead etc. are obtained from veins and lodes.   \n(ii) In sedimentary rocks a number of minerals occur in beds or layers. They have been formed as a result of deposition, accumulation and concentration in horizontal strata. Coal and some forms of iron ore have been concentrated as a result of long periods under great heat and pressure. Another group of sedimentary minerals include gypsum, potash salt and sodium salt. These are formed as a result of evaporation especially in arid regions.   \n(iii) Another mode of formation involves the decomposition of surface rocks, and the removal of soluble constituents, leaving a residual mass of weathered materialmaterial containing ores. Bauxite is formed this way.\n\n![](images/2a6c1d7c03b6e21915378d54a2ab33a12ad5dea26aa0ba9cd5dbade9711e22d4.jpg)  \nCLASSIFICATION OF MINERALS   \nFig. 5.1\n\n![](images/a8b5ece7f76dcd7dba2a825b796545cb47e39d53b3663c634a6d48574244fc11.jpg)\n\n(iv)Certain minerals may occur as alluvial alluvial deposits in s deposits ands of valley floors and the base of hills. These deposits are called ‘placer deposits’ and generally contain minerals, which are not corroded by water. Gold, silver, tin and platinum are most important among such minerals.   \n(v) The ocean waters contain vast quantities (v) of minerals, but most of these are too widely diffused to be of economic significance. However, common salt, magnesium and bromine are largely derived from ocean waters. The ocean beds, too, are rich in manganese nodules.",

    "text": "India is fortunate to have fairly rich and varied mineral resources. However, these are unevenly distributed. Broadly speaking, peninsular rocks contain most of the reserves of coal, metallic minerals, mica and many other non-metallic minerals. Sedimentary rocks on the western and eastern flanks of the peninsula, in Gujarat and Assam have most of the petroleum deposits. Rajasthan with the rock systems of the peninsula, has reserves of many\n\nnon-ferrous minerals. The vast alluvial plains of north India are almost devoid of economic minerals. These variations exist largely because of the differences in the geological structure, processes and time involved in the formation of minerals.\n\nLet us now study the distribution of a few major minerals in India. Always remember that the concentration of mineral in the ore, the ease of extraction and closeness to the market play an important role in affecting the economic viability of a reserve. Thus, to meet the demand, a choice has to be made between a number of possible options. When this is done a mineral ‘deposit’ or ‘reserve’ turns into a mine.",

The total volume of workable mineral deposits is an insignificant fraction i.e. one per cent of the earth’s crust. We are rapidly consuming mineral resources that required millions of years to be created and concentrated. The geological processes of mineral formation are so slow that the rates of replenishment are infinitely small in comparison to the present rates of consumption. Mineral resources are, therefore, finite and non-renewable. Rich\n\nmineral deposits are our country’s extremely valuable but short-lived possessions. Continued extraction of ores leads to increasing costs as mineral extraction comes from greater depths along with decrease in quality.\n\nA concerted effort has to be made in order to use our mineral resources in a planned and sustainable manner. Improved technologies need to be constantly evolved to allow use of low grade ores at low costs. Recycling of metals, using scrap metals and other substitutes are steps in conserving our mineral resources for the future.",

Promotion of energy conservation and increased use of renewable energy sources are the twin planks of sustainable energy.\n\nIndia is presently one of the least energy efficient countries in the world. We have to adopt a cautious approach for the judicious use of our limited energy resources.

His father explained that shoes, clothes, sugar etc. are manufactured by machines in large industries, some utensils are manufactured in small industries, while items like diyas are made by individual artisans in household industry.\n\nDo you have some ideas about these industries?\n\nProduction of goods in large quantities after processing from raw materials to more valuable products is called manufacturing. Do you know that paper is manufactured from wood, sugar from sugarcane, iron and steel from iron ore and aluminium from bauxite? Do you also know that some types of clothes are manufactured from yarn which itself is an industrial product?\n\nPeople employed in the secondary activities manufacture the primary materials into finished goods. The workers employed in steel factories, car, breweries, textile industries, bakeries etc. fall into this category. Some people are employed in providing services.

This was the main philosophy behind public sector industries and joint sector ventures in India. It was also aimed at bringing down regional disparities by establishing industries in tribal and backward areas.   \n• Export of manufactured goods expands trade and commerce, and brings in much needed foreign exchange.   \n• Countries that transform their raw materials into a wide variety of finished goods of higher value are prosperous. India’s prosperity lies in increasing and diversifying its manufacturing industries as quickly as possible.\n\nAgriculture and industry are not exclusive of each other. They move hand in hand. For instance, the agro-industries in India have given a major boost to agriculture by raising its productivity. They depend on the latter for raw materials and sell their products such as irrigation pumps, fertilisers, insecticides, pesticides, plastic and PVC pipes, machines and tools, etc. to the farmers. Thus, development and competitiveness of\n\nmanufacturing industry has not only assisted agriculturists in increasing their production but also made the production processes very efficient.\n\nIn the present day world of globalisation, our industry needs to be more efficient and competitive. Self-sufficiency alone is not enough. Our manufactured goods must be a t p a r i n q u a l i t y w i t h t h o s e i n t h e international market.

This limit has changed over a period of time. At present the maximum investment allowed is rupees one crore.\n\nOn the basis of ownership:\n\n• Public sector, owned and operated by government agencies – BHEL, SAIL etc.   \n• Private sector industries owned and operated by individuals or a group of individuals –TISCO, Bajaj Auto Ltd., Dabur Industries.   \n• Joint sector industries which are jointly run by the state and individuals or a group of individuals. Oil India Ltd. (OIL) is jointly owned by public and private sector.   \nCooperative sector industries are owned and operated by the producers or suppliers of raw materials, workers or both. They pool in the resources and share the profits or losses proportionately. Such examples are the sugar industry in Maharashtra, the coir industry in Kerala.\n\nBased on the bulk and weight of raw material and finished goods:\n\n• Heavy industries such as iron and steel   \n• Light industries that use light raw materials and produce light goods such as electrical goods industries.\n\n## \n\nClassify the following into two groups on the basis of bulk and weight of raw material and finished goods.\n\n(i) Oil\n\n(vi) Sewing Machines\n\n(ii) Knitting needles\n\n(vii) Shipbuilding\n\n(iii) Brassware\n\n(viii) Electric Bulbs\n\n(iv) Fuse wires\n\n(ix) Paint brushes\n\n(v) Watches\n\n(x) Automobiles",

It is the only industry in the country, which is self-reliant and complete in the value chain i.e., from raw material to the highest value added products.\n\nCotton Textiles: In ancient India, cotton textiles were produced with hand spinning and handloom weaving techniques. After the $1 8 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century, power-looms came into use. Our traditional industries suffered a setback during the colonial period because they could not compete with the mill-made cloth from England.\n\n• The first successful textile mill was established in Mumbai in 1854.   \n• The two world wars were fought in Europe, India was a British colony. There was a demand for cloth in U.K. hence, they gave a boost to the development of the cotton textile industry.\n\nIn the early years, the cotton textile industry was concentrated in the cotton growing belt of Maharashtra and Gujarat. Availability of raw cotton, market, transport including accessible port facilities, labour, moist climate, etc. contributed towards its localisation. This industry has close links with agriculture and provides a living to farmers, cotton boll pluckers and workers engaged in ginning, spinning, weaving,\n\ndyeing, designing, packaging, tailoring and sewing. The industry by creating demands supports many other industries, such as, chemicals and dyes, packaging materials and engineering works.\n\nWhile spinning continues to be centralised in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, weaving is highly decentralised to provide scope for incorporating traditional skills and designs of weaving in cotton, silk, zari, embroidery, etc. India has world class production in spinning, but weaving supplies low quality of fabric as it cannot use much of the high quality yarn produced in the country. Weaving is done by handloom, powerloom and in mills.\n\nThe handspun khadi provides large scale employment to weavers in their homes as a cottage industry.\n\nWhy did Mahatma Gandhi lay emphasis on spinning yarn and weaving khadi?\n\nWhy is it important for our country to keep the mill sector loomage lower than power loom and handloom?",

Industries are responsible for four types of pollution: (a) Air (b) Water (c) Land (d) Noise. The polluting industries also include thermal power plants.\n\nAir pollution is caused by the presence of high proportion of undesirable gases, such as sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide. Airborne particulate materials contain both solid and liquid particles like dust, sprays mist and smoke. Smoke is emitted by chemical and paper factories, brick kilns, refineries and smelting plants, and burning of fossil fuels in big and small factories that ignore pollution norms. Toxic gas leaks can be very hazardous with long-term effects. Are you aware of the Bhopal Gas tragedy that occurred? Air pollution adversely affects human health, animals, plants, buildings and the atmosphere as a whole.\n\nWater pollution is caused by organic and inorganic industrial wastes and affluents discharged into rivers. The main culprits in this regard are paper, pulp, chemical, textile and dyeing, petroleum refineries, tanneries and electroplating industries that let out dyes, detergents, acids, salts and heavy metals like lead and mercury pesticides, fertilisers, synthetic chemicals with carbon, plastics and rubber, etc. into the water bodies. Fly ash, phospo- gypsum and iron and steel slags are the major solid wastes in India.\n\nThermal pollution of water occurs when hot water from factories and thermal plants is drained into rivers and ponds before cooling. What would be the effect on aquatic life?\n\nWastes from nuclear power plants, nuclear and weapon production facilities cause cancers, birth defects and miscarriages. Soil iand and water pollution are closely related.\n\nDumping of wastes specially glass, harmful chemicals, industrial effluents, packaging, salts and garbage renders the soil useless. Rain water percolates to the soil carrying the pollutants to the ground and the ground water also gets contaminated.\n\nNoise pollution not only results in irritation and anger, it can also cause hearing impairment, increased heart rate and blood pressure among other physiological effects. Unwanted sound is an irritant and a source of stress. Industrial and construction activities, machinery, factory equipment, generators, saws and pneumatic and electric drills also make a lot of noise.",

Some of these are available in our immediate surroundings, while other requirements are met by bringing things from other places. Goods and services do not move from supply locales to demand locales on their own. The movement of these goods and services from their supply locations to demand locations necessitates the need for transport. Some people are engaged in facilitating these movements. These are known to be traders who make the products come to the consumers by transportation. Thus, the pace of development of a country depends upon the production of goods and services as well as their movement over space. Therefore, efficient means of transport are prerequisites for fast development.\n\nMovement of these goods and services can be over three important domains of our earth i.e. land, water and air. Based on these, transport can also be classified into land, water and air transport.\n\nthe help of equally developed communication system. Therefore, transport, communication and trade are complementary to each other.\n\nToday, India is well-linked with the rest of the world despite its vast size, diversity and linguistic and socio-cultural plurality. Railways, airways, waterways, newspapers, radio, television, cinema and internet, etc. have been contributing to its socio-economic progress in many ways. The trades from local to international levels have added to the vitality of its economy. It has enriched our life and added substantially to growing amenities and facilities for the comforts of life.\n\nIn this chapter, you will see how modern means of transport and communication serve as lifelines of our nation and its modern economy. It is thus, evident that a dense and efficient network of transport and communication is a prerequisite for local, national and global trade of today.\n\n![](images/b0ea8d44fa4a2df41e125a6adc2789076b7bc134baee6128812091e0e59b268f.jpg)  \nFig. 7.1\n\nFor a long time, trade and transport were restricted to a limited space. With the development in science and technology, the area of influence of trade and transport expanded far and wide.

They still have an edge over railways in view of the ease with which they can be built\n\nand maintained. The growing importance of road transport vis-à-vis rail transport is rooted in the following reasons; (a) construction cost of roads is much lower than that of railway lines, (b) roads can traverse comparatively more dissected and undulating topography, (c) roads can negotiate higher gradients of slopes and as such can traverse mountains such as the Himalayas, (d) road transport is economical in transportation of few persons and relatively smaller amount of goods over short distances, (e) it also provides doorto-door service, thus the cost of loading and unloading is much lower, (f) road transport is also used as a feeder to other modes of transport such as they provide a link between railway stations, air and sea ports.\n\nIn India, roads are classified in the following six classes according to their capacity. Look at the map of the National Highways and find out about the significant role played by these roads.\n\nGolden Quadrilateral Super Highways: Golden Quadrilateral Super The government has launched a major road development project linking Delhi-Kolkata-Chennai-Mumbai and Delhi by six-lane Super Highways. The North-South corridors linking Srinagar (Jammu & Kashmir) and Kanniyakumari (Tamil Nadu), and East-West Corridor connecting Silchar (Assam) and Porbander (Gujarat) are part of this project. The major objective of these Super Highways is to reduce the time and distance between the mega cities of India. These highway projects are being implemented by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).   \nNational Highways: National  National Highways link extreme parts of the country. These are the primary road systems. A number of major National Highways run in North-South and East-West directions.   \nState Highways: Roads linking a state capital with different district headquarters are known as State Highways.\n\n![](images/138590522fc3f04dd29f2dfa7d7b46d8aa2e8f33cc2b2c2ca450be19f6ce5383.jpg)  \nFig.7.2: Ahmedabad- Vadodara Expressway\n\n## \n\nCollect information of National Highway numbers (old and new) from the website morth.nic.in/national-highway-details. The historical Sher-Shah Suri Marg between Delhi and Amritsar is known by which National Highway ?\n\nDistrict Roads:Roads: These roads connect the district headquarters with other places of the district.   \nOther Roads:Other Roads: Rural roads, which link rural areas and villages with towns, are classified under this category. These roads received special impetus under the Pradhan Mantri Grameen Sadak Yojana. Under this scheme special provisions are made so that every village in the country is linked to a major town in the country by an all season motorable road.   \nBorder Roads:Border Apart from these, Border Roads Organisation a Government of India undertaking constructs and maintains roads in the bordering areas of the country. This organisation was established in 1960 for the development of the roads of strategic importance in the northern and north-eastern border areas. These roads have improved accessibility in areas of difficult terrain and have helped in the economic development of these area.\n\nLIFELINES OF NATIONAL ECONOMY\n\n![](images/11ad535ca7cae44db38b73d48c19daa63e9211bf01ae3e92eb1c29c4c2bec502.jpg)  \nIndia: National Highways",

Railways also make it possible for people to conduct multifarious activities like business, sightseeing, pilgrimage along with transportation of goods over longer distances. Apart from an important means of transport the Indian Railways have been a great integrating force for more than 150 years. Railways in India bind the economic life of the country as well as accelerate the development of the industry and agriculture.\n\nThe Indian Railways is the largest public sector undertaking in the country. The first train steamed off from Mumbai to Thane in 1853, covering a distance of 34 km.\n\nThe Indian Railway is now reorganised into 16 zones.\n\n## \n\nFind out the current Railway zones and their headquarters. Also locate the headquarters of Railway zones on the map of India.\n\nThe distribution pattern of the Railway network in the country has been largely influenced by physiographic, economic and administrative factors. The northern plains with their vast level land, high population density and rich agricultural resources provided the most favourable condition for their growth. However, a large number of rivers requiring construction of bridges across their wide beds posed some obstacles. In the hilly terrains of the peninsular region, railway tracts are laid through low hills, gaps or tunnels. The Himalayan mountainous regions too are unfavourable for the construction of railway lines due to high relief, sparse population and lack of economic opportunities. Likewise, it was difficult to lay railway lines on\n\nTable 7.1: India: Railway Track   \nThe Indian Railway network runs on multiple gauge operations extending over 67,956 km.   \n\n<table><tr><td>Gauge in metres</td><td>Route (Km)</td></tr><tr><td>Broad Gauge (1.676)</td><td>63950</td></tr><tr><td>Metre Gauge (1.000)</td><td>2,402</td></tr><tr><td>Narrow Gauge (0.762 and 0.610)</td><td>1,604</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>67,956</td></tr></table>\n\nSource: Railway Yearbook 2019–20, Ministry of Railways, Government of India.   \nWebsite: www.indianrailways.gov.in\n\nthe sandy plain of western Rajasthan, swamps of Gujarat, forested tracks of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Jharkhand.

In recent times, the development of the Konkan railway along the west coast has facilitated the movement of passengers and goods in this most important economic region of India. It has also faced a number of problem such as sinking of track in some stretches and landslides.\n\nToday, the railways have become more important in our national economy than all other means of transport put together. However, rail transport suffers from certain problems as well. Many passengers travel without tickets. Thefts and damaging of railway property has not yet stopped completely. People stop the trains, pull the chain unnecessarily and this causes heavy damage to the railway. Think over it, how we can help our railway in running as per the scheduled time?",

Waterways are the cheapest means of transport. They are most suitable for carrying heavy and bulky goods. It is a fuel-efficient and environment friendly mode of transport. India has inland navigation waterways of 14,500 km in length. Out of these only 5685 km are navigable by mechanised vessels. The following waterways have been declared as the National Waterways by the Government.\n\nLIFELINES OF NATIONAL ECONOMY\n\n![](images/7ec1687c63db9b99d168fbf81c3da28f19f82c9d71b4c8f488fa86844289796d.jpg)\n\n![](images/1a387491a110a5b06e916b61ba8aaa82e9ca201e96f5271c7bf21a7bb9713c4b.jpg)  \nFlg. 7.5: Inland waterways widely used in north-eastern states\n\n• The Ganga river between Allahabad and Haldia (1620 km)-N.W.

These major ports handle 95 per cent of India’s foreign trade.\n\nKandla in Kuchchh was the first port developed soon after Independence to ease the volume of trade on the Mumbai port, in the wake of loss of Karachi port to Pakistan after the Partition. Kandla also known as the Deendayal Port, is a tidal port. It caters to the\n\nconvenient handling of exports and imports of highly productive granary and industrial belt stretching across UT of Jammu and Kashmir, and the states of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat.\n\n![](images/718ff695fde14352152797f27d2cf6325b399b87747e97aa55312d59a1c78dc9.jpg)  \nFig. 7.6: Trucks being driven into the vessel at Mumbai port\n\nMumbai is the biggest port with a spacious natural and well-sheltered harbour. The Jawaharlal Nehru port was planned with a view to decongest the Mumbai port and serve as a hub port for this region. Marmagao port (Goa) is the premier iron ore exporting port of the country. This port accounts for about fifty per cent of India’s iron ore export. New Mangalore port, located in Karnataka caters to the export of iron ore concentrates from Kudremukh mines. Kochchi is the extreme south-western port, located at the entrance of a lagoon with a natural harbour.\n\n![](images/8fee9247cf0bed160f6a724825541c784f8bd31340d5bcfccae2e0093f90d0a5.jpg)  \nFig. 7.7: Tanker discharging crude oil at New Mangalore port\n\nMoving along the east coast, you would see the extreme south-eastern port of Tuticorin, in Tamil Nadu. This port has a natural harbour and rich hinterland. Thus, it has a flourishing trade handling of a large variety of cargoes to\n\neven our neighbouring countries like Sri Lanka, Maldives, etc. and the coastal regions of India. Chennai is one of the oldest artificial ports of the country. It is ranked next to Mumbai in terms of the volume of trade and cargo. Vishakhapatnam is the deepest landlocked and well-protected port. This port was, originally, conceived as an outlet for iron ore exports. Paradwip port located in Odisha, specialises in the export of iron ore. Kolkata is an inland riverine port. This port serves a very large and rich hinterland of Ganga-Brahmaputra basin. Being a tidal port, it requires constant dredging of Hoogly. Haldia port was developed as a subsidiary port, in order to relieve growing pressure on the Kolkata port.\n\n![](images/aee4540190e5dea25126a410c5edb013e53776ba0b7e9d9c49647a4289b4aacd.jpg)  \nFig. 7.8: Handling of oversize cargo at Tuticorin port",

Trade between two countries is called international trade. It may take place through sea, air or land routes.

Advancement of international trade of a country is an index to its economic prosperity. It is, therefore, considered the economic barometer for a country.\n\nAs the resources are space bound, no country can survive without international trade. Export and import are the components of trade. The balance of trade of a country is the difference between its export and import. When the value of export exceeds the value of imports, it is called a favourable balance of trade. On the contrary, if the value of imports exceeds the value of exports, it is termed as unfavourable balance of trade.\n\nIndia has trade relations with all the major trading blocks and all geographical regions of the world. The commodities exported from India to other countries include gems and jewellery, chemicals and related products, agriculture and allied products, etc.\n\nThe commodities imported to India include petroleum crude and products, gems and jewellery, chemicals and related products, base metals, electronic items, machinery, agriculture and allied products.

The first print (Fig. 1) of the series, shows the peoples of Europe and America – men and women of all ages and social classes – marching in a long train, and offering homage to the statue of Liberty as they pass by it. As you would recall, artists of the time of the French Revolution personified Liberty as a female figure – here you can recognise the torch of Enlightenment she bears in one hand and the Charter of the Rights of Man in the other. On the earth in the foreground of the image lie the shattered remains of the symbols of absolutist institutions. In Sorrieu’s utopian vision, the peoples of the world are grouped as distinct nations, identified through their flags and national costume. Leading the procession, way past the statue of Liberty, are the United States and Switzerland, which by this time were already nation-states. France,",

She is followed by the peoples of Germany, bearing the black, red and gold flag. Interestingly, at the time when Sorrieu created this image, the German peoples did not yet exist as a united nation – the flag they carry is an expression of liberal hopes in 1848 to unify the numerous German-speaking principalities into a nation-state under a democratic constitution. Following the German peoples are the peoples of Austria, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, Lombardy, Poland, England, Ireland, Hungary and Russia. From the heavens above, Christ, saints and angels gaze upon the scene. They have been used by the artist to symbolise fraternity among the nations of the world.\n\nThis chapter will deal with many of the issues visualised by Sorrieu in Fig. 1. During the nineteenth century, nationalism emerged as a force which brought about sweeping changes in the political and mental world of Europe. The end result of these changes was the emergence of the nation-state in place of the multi-national dynastic empires of Europe. The concept and practices of a modern state, in which a centralised power exercised sovereign control over a clearly defined territory, had been developing over a long period of time in Europe. But a nation-state was one in which the majority of its citizens, and not only its rulers, came to develop a sense of common identity and shared history or descent. This commonness did not exist from time immemorial; it was forged through struggles, through the actions of leaders and the common people. This chapter will look at the diverse processes through which nation-states and nationalism came into being in nineteenth-century Europe.",

The lecture was subsequently published as a famous essay entitled ‘Qu’est-ce qu’une nation?’ (‘What is a Nation?’). In this essay Renan criticises the notion suggested by others that a nation is formed by a common language, race, religion, or territory:\n\n‘A nation is the culmination of a long past of endeavours, sacrifice and devotion. A heroic past, great men, glory, that is the social capital upon which one bases a national idea. To have common glories in the past, to have a common will in the present, to have performed great deeds together, to wish to perform still more, these are the essential conditions of being a people. A nation is therefore a large-scale solidarity … Its existence is a daily plebiscite … A province is its inhabitants; if anyone has the right to be consulted, it is the inhabitant. A nation never has any real interest in annexing or holding on to a country against its will. The existence of nations is a good thing, a necessity even. Their existence is a guarantee of liberty, which would be lost if the world had only one law and only one master.’\n\nSource",

    "text": "The first clear expression of nationalism came with the French Revolution in 1789. France, as you would remember, was a full-fledged territorial state in 1789 under the rule of an absolute monarch. The political and constitutional changes that came in the wake of the French Revolution led to the transfer of sovereignty from the monarchy to a body of French citizens. The revolution proclaimed that it was the people who would henceforth constitute the nation and shape its destiny.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the French revolutionaries introduced various measures and practices that could create a sense of collective identity amongst the French people. The ideas of la patrie (the fatherland) and le citoyen (the citizen) emphasised\n\nthe notion of a united community enjoying equal rights under a constitution. A new French flag, the tricolour, was chosen to replace the former royal standard. The Estates General was elected by the body of active citizens and renamed the National Assembly. New hymns were composed, oaths taken and martyrs commemorated, all in the name of the nation. A centralised administrative system was put in place and it formulated uniform laws for all citizens within its territory. Internal customs duties and dues were abolished and a uniform system of weights and measures was adopted. Regional dialects were discouraged and French, as it was spoken and written in Paris, became the common language of the nation.\n\nThe revolutionaries further declared that it was the mission and the destiny of the French nation to liberate the peoples of Europe from despotism, in other words to help other peoples of Europe to become nations.\n\nWhen the news of the events in France reached the different cities of Europe, students and other members of educated middle classes began setting up Jacobin clubs. Their activities and campaigns prepared the way for the French armies which moved into Holland, Belgium, Switzerland and much of Italy in the 1790s. With the outbreak of the revolutionary wars, the French armies began to carry the idea of nationalism abroad.\n\n![](images/7510407e8dfbccbd27ba75fd89f7807e220f1e652971328aa7c94c09bc041b65.jpg)\n\nFig. 2 — The cover of a German almanac designed by the journalist Andreas Rebmann in 1798.   \n![](images/c2fd534f08b73ae9b450b3e5220ca2c03ef1ca2da232a2ae53b474dd98255559.jpg)  \nThe image of the French Bastille being stormed by the revolutionary crowd has been placed next to a similar fortress meant to represent the bastion of despotic rule in the German province of Kassel.

    "text": "Within the wide swathe of territory that came under his control, Napoleon set about introducing many of the reforms that he had already introduced in France. Through a return to monarchy Napoleon had, no doubt, destroyed democracy in France, but in the administrative field he had incorporated revolutionary principles in order to make the whole system more rational and efficient. The Civil Code of 1804 – usually known as the Napoleonic Code – did away with all privileges based on birth, established equality before the law and secured the right to property. This Code was exported to the regions under French control. In the Dutch Republic, in Switzerland, in Italy and Germany, Napoleon simplified administrative divisions, abolished the feudal system and freed peasants from serfdom and manorial dues. In the towns too, guild restrictions were removed. Transport and communication systems were improved. Peasants, artisans, workers and new businessmen\n\nFig. 4 — The Planting of Tree of Liberty in Zweibrücken, Germany.   \n![](images/9fc91aa59f4cfbd589699374bb811cde9c5dfd5ff00428ac7b22a910a7af3a07.jpg)  \nThe subject of this colour print by the German painter Karl Kaspar Fritz is the occupation of the town of Zweibrücken by the French armies. French soldiers, recognisable by their blue, white and red uniforms, have been portrayed as oppressors as they seize a peasant’s cart (left), harass some young women (centre foreground) and force a peasant down to his knees. The plaque being affixed to the Tree of Liberty carries a German inscription which in translation reads: ‘Take freedom and equality from us, the model of humanity.’ This is a sarcastic reference to the claim of the French as being liberators who opposed monarchy in the territories they entered.\n\nenjoyed a new-found freedom. Businessmen and small-scale producers of goods, in particular, began to realise that uniform laws, standardised weights and measures, and a common national currency would facilitate the movement and exchange of goods and capital from one region to another.\n\nHowever, in the areas conquered, the reactions of the local populations to French rule were mixed. Initially, in many places such as Holland and Switzerland, as well as in certain cities like Brussels, Mainz, Milan and Warsaw, the French armies were welcomed as harbingers of liberty. But the initial enthusiasm soon turned to hostility, as it became clear that the new administrative arrangements did not go hand in hand with political freedom. Increased taxation, censorship, forced conscription into the French armies required to conquer the rest of Europe, all seemed to outweigh the advantages of the administrative changes.\n\nFig. 5 — The courier of Rhineland loses all that he has on his way home from Leipzig.   \n![](images/b3c59dbd2ff66f799365d2555ccbb7356ab33844623b06c9bda90e0cf1137c2a.jpg)  \nNapoleon here is represented as a postman on his way back to France after he lost the battle of Leipzig in 1813.

Eastern and Central Europe were under autocratic monarchies within the territories of which lived diverse peoples. They did not see themselves as sharing a collective identity or a common culture. Often, they even spoke different languages and belonged to different ethnic groups. The Habsburg Empire that ruled over Austria-Hungary, for example, was a patchwork of many different regions and peoples. It included the Alpine regions – the Tyrol, Austria and the Sudetenland – as well as Bohemia, where the aristocracy was predominantly German-speaking. It also included the Italian-speaking provinces of Lombardy and Venetia. In Hungary, half of the population spoke Magyar while the other half spoke a variety of dialects. In Galicia, the aristocracy spoke Polish. Besides these three dominant groups, there also lived within the boundaries of the empire, a mass of subject peasant peoples – Bohemians and Slovaks to the north, Slovenes in Carniola, Croats to the south, and Roumans to the east in Transylvania. Such differences did not easily promote a sense of political unity. The only tie binding these diverse groups together was a common allegiance to the emperor.\n\nHow did nationalism and the idea of the nation-state emerge?",

    "text": "Ideas of national unity in early-nineteenth-century Europe were closely allied to the ideology of liberalism. The term ‘liberalism’ derives from the Latin root liber, meaning free. For the new middle classes liberalism stood for freedom for the individual and equality of all before the law. Politically, it emphasised the concept of government by consent. Since the French Revolution, liberalism had stood for the end of autocracy and clerical privileges, a constitution and representative government through parliament. Nineteenth-century liberals also stressed the inviolability of private property.\n\nYet, equality before the law did not necessarily stand for universal suffrage. You will recall that in revolutionary France, which marked the first political experiment in liberal democracy, the right to vote and to get elected was granted exclusively to property-owning men. Men without property and all women were excluded from political rights. Only for a brief period under the Jacobins did all adult males enjoy suffrage. However, the Napoleonic Code went back to limited suffrage and reduced women to the status of a minor, subject to the authority of fathers and husbands. Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries women and non-propertied men organised opposition movements demanding equal political rights.\n\nIn the economic sphere, liberalism stood for the freedom of markets and the abolition of state-imposed restrictions on the movement of goods and capital. During the nineteenth century this was a strong demand of the emerging middle classes. Let us take the example of the German-speaking regions in the first half of the nineteenth century. Napoleon’s administrative measures had created out of",

A merchant travelling in 1833 from Hamburg to Nuremberg to sell his goods would have had to pass through 11 customs barriers and pay a customs duty of about 5 per cent at each one of them. Duties were often levied according to the weight or measurement of the goods. As each region had its own system of weights and measures, this involved time-consuming calculation. The measure of cloth, for example, was the elle which in each region stood for a different length. An elle of textile material bought in Frankfurt would get you $5 4 . 7 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ of cloth, in Mainz $5 5 . 1 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ , in Nuremberg $6 5 . 6 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ , in Freiburg $5 3 . 5 \\mathrm { c m }$ .\n\nSuch conditions were viewed as obstacles to economic exchange and growth by the new commercial classes, who argued for the creation of a unified economic territory allowing the unhindered movement of goods, people and capital. In 1834, a customs union or zollverein was formed at the initiative of Prussia and joined by most of the German states. The union abolished tariff barriers and reduced the number of currencies from over thirty to two. The creation of a network of railways further stimulated mobility, harnessing economic interests to national unification.

    "text": "During the years following 1815, the fear of repression drove many liberal-nationalists underground. Secret societies sprang up in many European states to train revolutionaries and spread their ideas. To be revolutionary at this time meant a commitment to oppose monarchical forms that had been established after the Vienna Congress, and to fight for liberty and freedom. Most of these revolutionaries also saw the creation of nation-states as a necessary part of this struggle for freedom.\n\nOne such individual was the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Mazzini. Born in Genoa in 1807, he became a member of the secret society of the Carbonari. As a young man of 24, he was sent into exile in 1831 for attempting a revolution in Liguria. He subsequently founded two more underground societies, first, Young Italy in Marseilles, and then, Young Europe in Berne, whose members were like-minded young men from Poland, France, Italy and the German states. Mazzini believed that God had intended nations to be the natural units of mankind. So Italy could not continue to be a patchwork of small states and kingdoms. It had to be forged into a single unified republic within a wider alliance of nations. This unification alone could be the basis of Italian liberty. Following his model, secret societies were set up in Germany, France, Switzerland and Poland. Mazzini’s relentless opposition to monarchy and his vision of democratic republics frightened the conservatives. Metternich described him as ‘the most dangerous enemy of our social order’.\n\n![](images/1fce288d6bb95fc08dcc899e69a0ef0f83298c03c4247eaef5bec5842a4595eb.jpg)  \nFig. 7 — Giuseppe Mazzini and the founding of Young Europe in Berne 1833.

    "text": "As conservative regimes tried to consolidate their power, liberalism and nationalism came to be increasingly associated with revolution in many regions of Europe such as the Italian and German states, the provinces of the Ottoman Empire, Ireland and Poland. These revolutions were led by the liberal-nationalists belonging to the educated middle-class elite, among whom were professors, schoolteachers, clerks and members of the commercial middle classes.\n\nThe first upheaval took place in France in July 1830. The Bourbon kings who had been restored to power during the conservative reaction after 1815, were now overthrown by liberal revolutionaries who installed a constitutional monarchy with Louis Philippe at its head. ‘When France sneezes,’ Metternich once remarked, ‘the rest of Europe catches cold.’ The July Revolution sparked an uprising in Brussels which led to Belgium breaking away from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.\n\nAn event that mobilised nationalist feelings among the educated elite across Europe was the Greek war of independence. Greece had been part of the Ottoman Empire since the fifteenth century. The growth of revolutionary nationalism in Europe sparked off a struggle for independence amongst the Greeks which began in 1821. Nationalists in Greece got support from other Greeks living in exile and also from many West Europeans who had sympathies for ancient Greek culture. Poets and artists lauded Greece as the cradle of European civilisation and mobilised public opinion to support its struggle against a Muslim empire. The English poet Lord Byron organised funds and later went to fight in the war, where he died of fever in 1824. Finally, the Treaty of Constantinople of 1832 recognised Greece as an independent nation.",

    "text": "The development of nationalism did not come about only through wars and territorial expansion. Culture played an important role in creating the idea of the nation: art and poetry, stories and music helped express and shape nationalist feelings.\n\nLet us look at Romanticism, a cultural movement which sought to develop a particular form of nationalist sentiment. Romantic artists and poets generally criticised the glorification of reason and science\n\nFig. 8 — The Massacre at Chios, Eugene Delacroix, 1824.   \n![](images/5ad11c7b675daeaa6ea254577fa2e19b41d2467fe70bf5692d03f2fca570289b.jpg)  \nThe French painter Delacroix was one of the most important French Romantic painters. This huge painting (4.19m x 3.54m) depicts an incident in which 20,000 Greeks were said to have been killed by Turks on the island of Chios. By dramatising the incident, focusing on the suffering of women and children, and using vivid colours, Delacroix sought to appeal to the emotions of the spectators, and create sympathy for the Greeks.\n\nand focused instead on emotions, intuition and mystical feelings. Their effort was to create a sense of a shared collective heritage, a common cultural past, as the basis of a nation.\n\nOther Romantics such as the German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803) claimed that true German culture was to be discovered among the common people – das volk. It was through folk songs, folk poetry and folk dances that the true spirit of the nation (volksgeist) was popularised. So collecting and recording these forms of folk culture was essential to the project of nation-building.\n\nThe emphasis on vernacular language and the collection of local folklore was not just to recover an ancient national spirit, but also to carry the modern nationalist message to large audiences who were mostly illiterate. This was especially so in the case of Poland, which had been partitioned at the end of the eighteenth century by the Great Powers – Russia, Prussia and Austria. Even though Poland no longer existed as an independent territory, national feelings were kept alive through music and language. Karol Kurpinski, for example, celebrated the national struggle through his operas and music, turning folk dances like the polonaise and mazurka into nationalist symbols.\n\nLanguage too played an important role in developing nationalist sentiments. After Russian occupation, the Polish language was forced out of schools and the Russian language was imposed everywhere. In 1831, an armed rebellion against Russian rule took place which was ultimately crushed. Following this, many members of the clergy in Poland began to use language as a weapon of national resistance. Polish was used for Church gatherings and all religious instruction. As a result, a large number of priests and bishops were put in jail or sent to Siberia by the Russian authorities as punishment for their refusal to preach in Russian. The use of Polish came to be seen as a symbol of the struggle against Russian dominance.",

    "text": "The 1830s were years of great economic hardship in Europe. The first half of the nineteenth century saw an enormous increase in population all over Europe. In most countries there were more seekers of jobs than employment. Population from rural areas migrated to the cities to live in overcrowded slums. Small producers in towns were often faced with stiff competition from imports of cheap machine-made goods from England, where industrialisation was more advanced than on the continent. This was especially so in textile production, which was carried out mainly in homes or small workshops and was only partly mechanised. In those regions of Europe where the aristocracy still enjoyed power, peasants struggled under the burden of feudal dues and obligations. The rise of food prices or a year of bad harvest led to widespread pauperism in town and country.\n\nThe year 1848 was one such year. Food shortages and widespread unemployment brought the population of Paris out on the roads. Barricades were erected and Louis Philippe was forced to flee. A",

While both of them studied law, they soon developed an interest in collecting old folktales. They spent six years travelling from village to village, talking to people and writing down fairy tales, which were handed down through the generations. These were popular both among children and adults. In 1812, they published their first collection of tales. Subsequently, both the brothers became active in liberal politics, especially the movement for freedom of the press. In the meantime they also published a 33-volume dictionary of the German language.\n\nThe Grimm brothers also saw French domination as a threat to German culture, and believed that the folktales they had collected were expressions of a pure and authentic German spirit. They considered their projects of collecting folktales and developing the German language as part of the wider effort to oppose French domination and create a German national identity.",

They were treated with scorn and threats alternately.

Write a report on what you saw.\n\n### 3.3 1848: The Revolution of the Liberals\n\nParallel to the revolts of the poor, unemployed and starving peasants and workers in many European countries in the year 1848, a revolution led by the educated middle classes was under way. Events of February 1848 in France had brought about the abdication of the monarch and a republic based on universal male suffrage had been proclaimed. In other parts of Europe where independent nation-states did not yet exist – such as Germany, Italy, Poland, the Austro-Hungarian Empire – men and women of the liberal middle classes combined their demands for constitutionalism with national unification. They took advantage of the growing popular unrest to push their demands for the creation of a nation-state on parliamentary principles – a constitution, freedom of the press and freedom of association.\n\nIn the German regions a large number of political associations whose members were middle-class professionals, businessmen and prosperous artisans came together in the city of Frankfurt and decided to vote for an all-German National Assembly. On 18 May 1848, 831 elected representatives marched in a festive procession to take their places in the Frankfurt parliament convened in the Church of St Paul. They drafted a constitution for a German nation to be headed by a monarchy subject to a parliament. When the deputies offered the crown on these terms to Friedrich Wilhelm IV, King of Prussia, he rejected it and joined other monarchs to oppose the elected assembly. While the opposition of the aristocracy and military became stronger, the social basis of parliament eroded. The parliament was dominated by the middle classes who resisted the demands of workers and artisans and consequently lost their support. In the end troops were called in and the assembly was forced to disband.\n\nThe issue of extending political rights to women was a controversial one within the liberal movement, in which large numbers of women had participated actively over the years. Women had formed their own political associations, founded newspapers and taken part in political meetings and demonstrations. Despite this they were denied",

Woman, the weaker, dependent and timid, requires the protection of man. Her sphere is the home, the care of the children, the nurturing of the family … Do we require any further proof that given such differences, equality between the sexes would only endanger harmony and destroy the dignity of the family?’\n\nLouise Otto-Peters (1819-95) was a political activist who founded a women’s journal and subsequently a feminist political association. The first issue of her newspaper (21 April 1849) carried the following editorial:\n\n‘Let us ask how many men, possessed by thoughts of living and dying for the sake of Liberty, would be prepared to fight for the freedom of the entire people, of all human beings? When asked this question, they would all too easily respond with a “Yes!”, though their untiring efforts are intended for the benefit of only one half of humanity – men. But Liberty is indivisible! Free men therefore must not tolerate to be surrounded by the unfree\n\nAn anonymous reader of the same newspaper sent the following letter to the editor on 25 June 1850:\n\n‘It is indeed ridiculous and unreasonable to deny women political rights even though they enjoy the right to property which they make use of. They perform functions and assume responsibilities without however getting the benefits that accrue to men for the same … Why this injustice? Is it not a disgrace that even the stupidest cattle-herder possesses the right to vote, simply because he is a man, whereas highly talented women owning considerable property are excluded from this right, even though they contribute so much to the maintenance of the state?’ Source\n\n![](images/c8e6400400f59e068b359f952e406bfedc699399e255759be04da69917293966.jpg)  \nFig. 10 — The Frankfurt parliament in the Church of St Paul.

Monarchs were beginning to realise that the cycles of revolution and repression could only be ended by granting concessions to the liberal-nationalist revolutionaries. Hence, in the years after 1848, the autocratic monarchies of Central and Eastern Europe began to introduce the changes that had already taken place in Western Europe before 1815. Thus serfdom and bonded labour were abolished both in the Habsburg dominions and in Russia. The Habsburg rulers granted more autonomy to the Hungarians in 1867.",

    "text": "### 4.1 Germany – Can the Army be the Architect of a Nation?\n\nAfter 1848, nationalism in Europe moved away from its association with democracy and revolution. Nationalist sentiments were often mobilised by conservatives for promoting state power and achieving political domination over Europe.\n\nThis can be observed in the process by which Germany and Italy came to be unified as nation-states. As you have seen, nationalist feelings were widespread among middle-class Germans, who in 1848 tried to unite the different regions of the German confederation into a nation-state governed by an elected parliament. This liberal initiative to nation-building was, however, repressed by the combined forces of the monarchy and the military, supported by the large landowners (called Junkers) of Prussia.\n\nFrom then on, Prussia took on the leadership of the movement for national unification. Its chief minister, Otto von Bismarck, was the architect of this process carried out with the help of the Prussian army and bureaucracy. Three wars over seven years – with Austria, Denmark and France – ended in Prussian victory and completed the process of unification. In January 1871, the Prussian king, William I, was proclaimed German Emperor in aceremony held at Versailles.\n\nOn the bitterly cold morning of 18 January 1871, an assembly comprising the princes of the German states, representatives of the army, important Prussian ministers including the chief minister Otto von Bismarck gathered in the unheated Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles to proclaim the new German Empire headed by Kaiser William I of Prussia.\n\nThe nation-building process in Germany had demonstrated the dominance of Prussian state power. The new state placed a strong emphasis on modernising the currency, banking, legal and judicial systems in Germany. Prussian measures and practices often became a model for the rest of Germany.\n\n![](images/3ffd16d39281b30303d5ef9ac2cd1fa77ce1cacc9b547e57a14ffae1b956f653.jpg)  \nFig. 11 — The proclamation of the German empire in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, Anton von Werner.

During the middle of the nineteenth century, Italy was divided into seven states, of which only one, Sardinia-Piedmont, was ruled by an Italian princely house. The north was under Austrian Habsburgs, the centre was ruled by the Pope and the southern regions were under the domination of the Bourbon kings of Spain. Even the Italian language had not acquired one common form and still had many regional and local variations.\n\nDuring the 1830s, Giuseppe Mazzini had sought to put together a coherent programme for a unitary Italian Republic. He had also formed a secret society called Young Italy for the dissemination of his goals. The failure of revolutionary uprisings both in 1831 and 1848 meant that the mantle now fell on Sardinia-Piedmont under its ruler King Victor Emmanuel II to unify the Italian states through war. In the eyes of the ruling elites of this region, a unified Italy offered them the possibility of economic development and political dominance.\n\n![](images/be59d35584f2025829d09850d1ccb970aab3ff68899d2b09fe9d0a667de8bdb7.jpg)  \nFig. 13 — Caricature of Otto von Bismarck in the German reichstag (parliament), from Figaro, Vienna, 5 March 1870.",

In 1860, they marched into South Italy and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and succeeded in winning the support of the local peasants in order to drive out the Spanish rulers. In 1861 Victor Emmanuel II was proclaimed king of united Italy. However, much of the Italian population, among whom rates of illiteracy were very high, remained blissfully unaware of liberalnationalist ideology. The peasant masses who had supported Garibaldi in southern Italy had never heard of Italia, and believed that ‘La Talia’ was Victor Emmanuel’s wife!\n\n![](images/68f75a490e83073df12469940225361e139505f7dfdfb0007a3537f5b28e0205.jpg)  \nFig. 14(a) — Italian states before unification, 1858.",

It was the result of a long-drawn-out process. There was no British nation prior to the eighteenth century. The primary identities of the people who inhabited the British Isles were ethnic ones – such as English, Welsh, Scot or Irish. All of these ethnic groups had their own cultural and political traditions. But as the English nation steadily grew in wealth, importance and power, it was able to extend its influence over the other nations of the islands. The English parliament, which had seized power from the monarchy in 1688 at the end of a protracted conflict, was the instrument through which a nation-state, with England at its centre, came to be forged. The Act of Union (1707) between England and Scotland that resulted in the formation of the ‘United Kingdom of Great Britain’ meant, in effect, that England was able to impose its influence on Scotland. The British parliament was henceforth dominated by its English members. The growth of a British identity meant that Scotland’s distinctive culture and political institutions were systematically suppressed. The Catholic clans that inhabited the Scottish Highlands suffered terrible repression whenever they attempted to assert their independence. The Scottish Highlanders were forbidden to speak their Gaelic language or wear their national dress, and large numbers were forcibly driven out of their homeland.\n\nIreland suffered a similar fate. It was a country deeply divided between Catholics and Protestants. The English helped the Protestants of Ireland to establish their dominance over a largely Catholic country. Catholic revolts against British dominance were suppressed. After a failed revolt led by Wolfe Tone and his United Irishmen (1798), Ireland was forcibly incorporated into the United Kingdom in 1801. A new ‘British nation’ was forged through the propagation of a dominant English culture. The symbols of the new Britain – the British flag (Union Jack), the national anthem (God Save Our Noble King), the English language – were actively promoted and the older nations survived only as subordinate partners in this union.",

    "text": "Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807-82) is perhaps the most celebrated of Italian freedom fighters. He came from a family engaged in coastal trade and was a sailor in the merchant navy. In 1833 he met Mazzini, joined the Young Italy movement and participated in a republican uprising in Piedmont in 1834. The uprising was suppressed and Garibaldi had to flee to South America, where he lived in exile till 1848. In 1854, he supported Victor Emmanuel II in his efforts to unify the Italian states. In 1860, Garibaldi led the famous Expedition of the Thousand to South Italy. Fresh volunteers kept joining through the course of the campaign, till their numbers grew to about 30,000. They were popularly known as Red Shirts.\n\nIn 1867, Garibaldi led an army of volunteers to Rome to fight the last obstacle to the unification of Italy, the Papal States where a French garrison was stationed. The Red Shirts proved to be no match for the combined French and Papal troops. It was only in 1870 when, during the war with Prussia, France withdrew its troops from Rome that the Papal States were finally joined to Italy.\n\n![](images/99031cd333052a1d5593191cf61126f2363b9081ca5482f53d7dd85bfdee3426.jpg)  \nFig. 15 – Garibaldi helping King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia-Piedmont to pull on the boot named ‘Italy’.

    "text": "While it is easy enough to represent a ruler through a portrait or a statue, how does one go about giving a face to a nation? Artists in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries found a way out by personifying a nation. In other words they represented a country as if it were a person. Nations were then portrayed as female figures. The female form that was chosen to personify the nation did not stand for any particular woman in real life; rather it sought to give the abstract idea of the nation a concrete form. That is, the female figure became an allegory of the nation.\n\nYou will recall that during the French Revolution artists used the female allegory to portray ideas such as Liberty, Justice and the Republic. These ideals were represented through specific objects or symbols. As you would remember, the attributes of Liberty are the red cap, or the broken chain, while Justice is generally a blindfolded woman carrying a pair of weighing scales.\n\nSimilar female allegories were invented by artists in the nineteenth century to represent the nation. In France she was christened Marianne, a popular Christian name, which underlined the idea of a people’s nation. Her characteristics were drawn from those of Liberty and the Republic – the red cap, the tricolour, the cockade. Statues of Marianne were erected in public squares to remind the public of the national symbol of unity and to persuade them to identify with it. Marianne images were marked on coins and stamps.\n\nSimilarly, Germania became the allegory of the German nation. In visual representations, Germania wears a crown of oak leaves, as the German oak stands for heroism.",

    "text": "By the last quarter of the nineteenth century nationalism no longer retained its idealistic liberal-democratic sentiment of the first half of the century, but became a narrow creed with limited ends. During this period nationalist groups became increasingly intolerant of each other and ever ready to go to war. The major European powers, in turn, manipulated the nationalist aspirations of the subject peoples in Europe to further their own imperialist aims.\n\nThe most serious source of nationalist tension in Europe after 1871 was the area called the Balkans. The Balkans was a region of geographical and ethnic variation comprising modern-day Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Greece, Macedonia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro whose inhabitants were broadly known as the Slavs. A large part of the Balkans was under the control of the Ottoman Empire. The spread of the ideas of romantic nationalism in the Balkans together with the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire made this region very explosive. All through the nineteenth century the Ottoman Empire had sought to strengthen itself through modernisation and internal reforms but with very little success. One by one, its European subject nationalities broke away from its control and declared independence. The Balkan peoples based their claims for independence or political rights on nationality and used history to prove that they had once been independent but had subsequently been subjugated by foreign powers. Hence the rebellious nationalities in the Balkans thought of their struggles as attempts to win back their long-lost independence.\n\nAs the different Slavic nationalities struggled to define their identity and independence, the Balkan area became an area of intense conflict. The Balkan states were fiercely jealous of each other and each hoped to gain more territory at the expense of the others. Matters were further complicated because the Balkans also became the scene of big power rivalry. During this period, there was intense rivalry among the European powers over trade and colonies as well as naval and military might. These rivalries were very evident in the way the Balkan problem unfolded. Each power – Russia, Germany, England, Austro-Hungary – was keen on countering the hold of other powers over the Balkans, and extending its own control over the area. This led to a series of wars in the region and finally the First World War.\n\nFig. 20 — A map celebrating the British Empire.   \n![](images/96a83025d20db6cd7b0f78f014ec7ac7e72e862d76cf42ca4487165d8f922a3e.jpg)  \nAt the top, angels are shown carrying the banner of freedom.

    "text": "As you have seen, modern nationalism in Europe came to be associated with the formation of nation-states. It also meant a change in people’s understanding of who they were, and what defined their identity and sense of belonging. New symbols and icons, new songs and ideas forged new links and redefined the boundaries of communities. In most countries the making of this new national identity was a long process. How did this consciousness emerge in India?\n\nIn India and as in many other colonies, the growth of modern nationalism is intimately connected to the anti-colonial movement. People began discovering their unity in the process of their struggle with colonialism. The sense of being oppressed under colonialism provided a shared bond that tied many different groups together. But each class and group felt the effects of colonialism differently, their experiences were varied, and their notions of freedom were not always the same. The Congress under Mahatma Gandhi tried to forge these groups together within one movement. But the unity did not emerge without conflict.\n\nIn an earlier textbook you have read about the growth of nationalism in India up to the first decade of the twentieth century. In this chapter we will pick up the story from the 1920s and study the Non-Cooperation and Civil Disobedience Movements. We will explore how the Congress sought to develop the national movement, how different social groups participated in the movement, and how nationalism captured the imagination of people.\n\n1066CH02\n\n![](images/dad009dd46af660fc892cbafcc2e5b5000be2da648f50d3a3b71b2e5651510b1.jpg)  \nFig. 1 – 6 April 1919.

How do we understand these developments? What implications did they have?\n\nFirst of all, the war created a new economic and political situation. It led to a huge increase in defence expenditure which was financed by war loans and increasing taxes: customs duties were raised and income tax introduced. Through the war years prices increased – doubling between 1913 and 1918 – leading to extreme hardship for the common people. Villages were called upon to supply soldiers, and the forced recruitment in rural areas caused widespread anger. Then in 1918-19 and 1920-21, crops failed in many parts of India, resulting in acute shortages of food. This was accompanied by an influenza epidemic. According to the census of 1921, 12 to 13 million people perished as a result of famines and the epidemic.\n\nPeople hoped that their hardships would end after the war was over. But that did not happen.\n\nAt this stage a new leader appeared and suggested a new mode of struggle.",

When the marchers were stopped and Gandhiji arrested, thousands of more workers joined the satyagraha against racist laws that denied rights to non-whites.\n\nthe racist regime with a novel method of mass agitation, which he called satyagraha. The idea of satyagraha emphasised the power of truth and the need to search for truth. It suggested that if the cause was true, if the struggle was against injustice, then physical force was not necessary to fight the oppressor. Without seeking vengeance or being aggressive, a satyagrahi could win the battle through nonviolence. This could be done by appealing to the conscience of the oppressor. People – including the oppressors – had to be persuaded to see the truth, instead of being forced to accept truth through the use of violence. By this struggle, truth was bound to ultimately triumph. Mahatma Gandhi believed that this dharma of non-violence could unite all Indians.\n\nAfter arriving in India, Mahatma Gandhi successfully organised satyagraha movements in various places. In 1917 he travelled to Champaran in Bihar to inspire the peasants to struggle against the oppressive plantation system. Then in 1917, he organised a satyagraha to support the peasants of the Kheda district of Gujarat. Affected by crop failure and a plague epidemic, the peasants of Kheda could not pay the revenue, and were demanding that revenue collection be relaxed. In 1918, Mahatma Gandhi went to Ahmedabad to organise a satyagraha movement amongst cotton mill workers.",

Alarmed by the popular upsurge, and scared that lines of communication such as the railways and telegraph would be disrupted, the British administration decided to clamp down on nationalists.

    "text": "Read the text carefully. What did Mahatma Gandhi mean when he said satyagraha is active resistance?\n\nOn 13 April the infamous Jallianwalla Bagh incident took place. On that day a large crowd gathered in the enclosed ground of Jallianwalla Bagh. Some came to protest against the government’s new repressive measures. Others had come to attend the annual Baisakhi fair. Being from outside the city, many villagers were unaware of the martial law that had been imposed. Dyer entered the area, blocked the exit points, and opened fire on the crowd, killing hundreds. His object, as he declared later, was to ‘produce a moral effect’, to create in the minds of satyagrahis a feeling of terror and awe.\n\nAs the news of Jallianwalla Bagh spread, crowds took to the streets in many north Indian towns. There were strikes, clashes with the police and attacks on government buildings. The government responded with brutal repression, seeking to humiliate and terrorise people: satyagrahis were forced to rub their noses on the ground, crawl on the streets, and do salaam (salute) to all sahibs; people were flogged and villages (around Gujranwala in Punjab, now in Pakistan) were bombed. Seeing violence spread, Mahatma Gandhi called off the movement.\n\nWhile the Rowlatt satyagraha had been a widespread movement, it was still limited mostly to cities and towns. Mahatma Gandhi now felt the need to launch a more broad-based movement in India. But he was certain that no such movement could be organised without bringing the Hindus and Muslims closer together. One way of doing this, he felt, was to take up the Khilafat issue. The First World War had ended with the defeat of Ottoman Turkey. And there were rumours that a harsh peace treaty was going to be imposed on the Ottoman emperor – the spiritual head of the Islamic world (the Khalifa). To defend the Khalifa’s temporal powers, a Khilafat Committee was formed in Bombay in March 1919. A young generation of Muslim leaders like the brothers Muhammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, began discussing with Mahatma Gandhi about the possibility of a united mass action on the issue. Gandhiji saw this as an opportunity to bring Muslims under the umbrella of a unified national movement. At the Calcutta session of the Congress in September 1920, he convinced other leaders of the need to start a non-cooperation movement in support of Khilafat as well as for swaraj.",

If Indians refused to cooperate, British rule in India would collapse within a year, and swaraj would come.\n\nHow could non-cooperation become a movement? Gandhiji proposed that the movement should unfold in stages. It should begin with the surrender of titles that the government awarded, and a boycott of civil services, army, police, courts and legislative councils, schools, and foreign goods. Then, in case the government used repression, a full civil disobedience campaign would be launched. Through the summer of 1920 Mahatma Gandhi and Shaukat Ali toured extensively, mobilising popular support for the movement.\n\nMany within the Congress were, however, concerned about the proposals. They were reluctant to boycott the council elections scheduled for November 1920, and they feared that the movement might lead to popular violence. In the months between September and December there was an intense tussle within the Congress. For a while there seemed no meeting point between the supporters and the opponents of the movement. Finally, at the Congress session at Nagpur in December 1920, a compromise was worked out and the Non-Cooperation programme was adopted.\n\nHow did the movement unfold? Who participated in it? How did different social groups conceive of the idea of Non-Cooperation?",

    "text": "The Non-Cooperation-Khilafat Movement began in January 1921. Various social groups participated in this movement, each with its own specific aspiration. All of them responded to the call of Swaraj, but the term meant different things to different people.\n\n### 2.1 The Movement in the Towns\n\nThe movement started with middle-class participation in the cities. Thousands of students left government-controlled schools and colleges, headmasters and teachers resigned, and lawyers gave up their legal practices. The council elections were boycotted in most provinces except Madras, where the Justice Party, the party of the non-Brahmans, felt that entering the council was one way of gaining some power – something that usually only Brahmans had access to.\n\nThe effects of non-cooperation on the economic front were more dramatic. Foreign goods were boycotted, liquor shops picketed, and foreign cloth burnt in huge bonfires. The import of foreign cloth halved between 1921 and 1922, its value dropping from Rs 102 crore to Rs 57 crore. In many places merchants and traders refused to trade in foreign goods or finance foreign trade. As the boycott movement spread, and people began discarding imported clothes and wearing only Indian ones, production of Indian textile mills and handlooms went up.\n\nBut this movement in the cities gradually slowed down for a variety of reasons. Khadi cloth was often more expensive than massproduced mill cloth and poor people could not afford to buy it. How then could they boycott mill cloth for too long? Similarly the boycott of British institutions posed a problem. For the movement to be successful, alternative Indian institutions had to be set up so that they could be used in place of the British ones. These were slow to come up. So students and teachers began trickling back to government schools and lawyers joined back work in government courts.",

The movement here was against talukdars and landlords who demanded from peasants exorbitantly high rents and a variety of other cesses. Peasants had to do begar and work at landlords’ farms without any payment. As tenants they had no security of tenure, being regularly evicted so that they could acquire no right over the leased land. The peasant movement demanded reduction of revenue, abolition of begar, and social boycott of oppressive landlords. In many places nai – dhobi bandhs were organised by panchayats to deprive landlords of the services of even barbers and washermen. In June 1920, Jawaharlal Nehru began going around the villages in Awadh, talking to the villagers, and trying to understand their grievances. By October, the Oudh Kisan Sabha was set up headed by Jawaharlal Nehru, Baba Ramchandra and a few others. Within a month, over 300 branches had been set up in the villages around the region. So when the Non-Cooperation Movement began the following year, the effort of the Congress was to integrate the Awadh peasant struggle into the wider struggle. The peasant movement, however, developed in forms that the Congress leadership was unhappy with. As the movement spread in 1921, the houses of talukdars and merchants were attacked, bazaars were looted, and grain hoards were taken over. In many places local leaders told peasants that Gandhiji had declared that no taxes were to be paid and land was to be redistributed among the poor. The name of the Mahatma was being invoked to sanction all action and aspirations.",

    "text": "On 6 January 1921, the police in United Provinces fired at peasants near Rae Bareli. Jawaharlal Nehru wanted to go to the place of firing, but was stopped by the police. Agitated and angry, Nehru addressed the peasants who gathered around him. This is how he later described the meeting:\n\n‘They behaved as brave men, calm and unruffled in the face of danger. I do not know how they felt but I know what my feelings were. For a moment my blood was up, non-violence was almost forgotten – but for a moment only. The thought of the great leader, who by God’s goodness has been sent to lead us to victory, came to me, and I saw the kisans seated and standing near me,less excited, more peaceful than I was-and the moment of weakness passed,I spoke to them in all humility on non-violence – I needed the lesson more than they – and they heeded me and peacefully dispersed.’\n\nQuoted in Sarvapalli Gopal, Jawaharlal Nehru: A Biography, Vol. I.\n\nTribal peasants interpreted the message of Mahatma Gandhi and the idea of swaraj in yet another way. In the Gudem Hills of Andhra Pradesh, for instance, a militant guerrilla movement spread in the early $1 9 2 0 \\mathrm { s } -$ not a form of struggle that the Congress could approve. Here, as in other forest regions, the colonial government had closed large forest areas, preventing people from entering the forests to graze their cattle, or to collect fuelwood and fruits. This enraged the hill people. Not only were their livelihoods affected but they felt that their traditional rights were being denied. When the government began forcing them to contribute begar for road building, the hill people revolted. The person who came to lead them was an interesting figure. Alluri Sitaram Raju claimed that he had a variety of special powers: he could make correct astrological predictions and heal people, and he could survive even bullet shots. Captivated by Raju, the rebels proclaimed that he was an incarnation of God. Raju talked of the greatness of Mahatma Gandhi, said he was inspired by the Non-Cooperation Movement, and persuaded people to wear khadi and give up drinking. But at the same time he asserted that India could be liberated only by the use of force, not non-violence. The Gudem rebels attacked police stations, attempted to kill British officials and carried on guerrilla warfare for achieving swaraj. Raju was captured and executed in 1924, and over time became a folk hero.",

    "text": "In February 1922, Mahatma Gandhi decided to withdraw the Non-Cooperation Movement. He felt the movement was turning violent in many places and satyagrahis needed to be properly trained before they would be ready for mass struggles. Within the Congress, some leaders were by now tired of mass struggles and wanted to participate in elections to the provincial councils that had been set up by the Government of India Act of 1919. They felt that it was important to oppose British policies within the councils, argue for reform and also demonstrate that these councils were not truly democratic. C. R. Das and Motilal Nehru formed the Swaraj Party within the Congress to argue for a return to council politics. But younger leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose pressed for more radical mass agitation and for full independence.\n\nIn such a situation of internal debate and dissension two factors again shaped Indian politics towards the late 1920s. The first was the effect of the worldwide economic depression. Agricultural prices began to fall from 1926 and collapsed after 1930. As the demand for agricultural goods fell and exports declined, peasants found it difficult to sell their harvests and pay their revenue. By 1930, the countryside was in turmoil.\n\nAgainst this background the new Tory government in Britain constituted a Statutory Commission under Sir John Simon. Set up\n\nin response to the nationalist movement, the commission was to look into the functioning of the constitutional system in India and suggest changes. The problem was that the commission did not have a single Indian member. They were all British.\n\nWhen the Simon Commission arrived in India in 1928, it was greeted with the slogan ‘Go back Simon’. All parties, including the Congress and the Muslim League, participated in the demonstrations. In an effort to win them over, the viceroy, Lord Irwin, announced in October 1929, a vague offer of ‘dominion status’ for India in an unspecified future, and a Round Table Conference to discuss a future constitution. This did not satisfy the Congress leaders. The radicals within the Congress, led by\n\nLala Lajpat Rai was assaulted by the British police during a peaceful demonstration against the Simon Commission. He succumbed to injuries that were inflicted on him during the demonstration.\n\n![](images/f9f7c8ee4deb2745639f987d9721acd65dae80418e6160261e2997bf6fba460f.jpg)  \nFig. 6 – Meeting of Congress leaders at Allahabad, 1931.

    "text": "Mahatma Gandhi found in salt a powerful symbol that could unite the nation. On 31 January 1930, he sent a letter to Viceroy Irwin stating eleven demands. Some of these were of general interest; others were specific demands of different classes, from industrialists to peasants. The idea was to make the demands wide-ranging, so that all classes within Indian society could identify with them and everyone could be brought together in a united campaign. The most stirring of all was the demand to abolish the salt tax. Salt was something consumed by the rich and the poor alike, and it was one of the most essential items of food. The tax on salt and the government monopoly over its production, Mahatma Gandhi declared, revealed the most oppressive face of British rule.\n\nMahatma Gandhi’s letter was, in a way, an ultimatum. If the demands were not fulfilled by 11 March, the letter stated, the Congress would launch a civil disobedience campaign. Irwin was unwilling to negotiate. So Mahatma Gandhi started his famous salt march accompanied by 78 of his trusted volunteers. The march was over 240 miles, from Gandhiji’s ashram in Sabarmati to the Gujarati coastal town of Dandi. The volunteers walked for 24 days, about 10 miles a day. Thousands came to hear Mahatma Gandhi wherever he stopped, and he told them what he meant by swaraj and urged them to peacefully defy the British. On 6 April he reached Dandi, and ceremonially violated the law, manufacturing salt by boiling sea water.\n\nThis marked the beginning of the Civil Disobedience Movement.

Peasants refused to pay revenue and chaukidari taxes, village officials resigned, and in many places forest people violated forest laws – going into Reserved Forests to collect wood and graze cattle.\n\nWorried by the developments, the colonial government began arresting the Congress leaders one by one. This led to violent clashes in many palaces. When Abdul Ghaffar Khan, a devout disciple of Mahatma Gandhi, was arrested in April 1930, angry crowds demonstrated in the streets of Peshawar, facing armoured cars and police firing. Many were killed. A month later, when Mahatma Gandhi himself was arrested, industrial workers in Sholapur attacked police posts, municipal buildings, lawcourts and railway stations – all structures that symbolised British rule. A frightened government responded with a policy of brutal repression. Peaceful satyagrahis were attacked, women and children were beaten, and about 100,000 people were arrested.\n\nIn such a situation, Mahatma Gandhi once again decided to call off the movement and entered into a pact with Irwin on 5 March 1931. By this Gandhi-Irwin Pact, Gandhiji consented to participate in a Round Table Conference (the Congress had boycotted the first\n\n![](images/6057176efe35b9e6b24ae5d4dc5acd764a146add058a0c6f752e1c668c0100d3.jpg)  \nFig. 8 – Police cracked down on satyagrahis, 1930.\n\nRound Table Conference) in London and the government agreed to release the political prisoners. In December 1931, Gandhiji went to London for the conference, but the negotiations broke down and he returned disappointed. Back in India, he discovered that the government had begun a new cycle of repression. Ghaffar Khan and Jawaharlal Nehru were both in jail, the Congress had been declared illegal, and a series of measures had been imposed to prevent meetings, demonstrations and boycotts. With great apprehension, Mahatma Gandhi relaunched the Civil Disobedience Movement. For over a year, the movement continued, but by 1934 it lost its momentum.",

    "text": "Let us now look at the different social groups that participated in the Civil Disobedience Movement. Why did they join the movement? What were their ideals? What did swaraj mean to them?\n\nIn the countryside, rich peasant communities – like the Patidars of Gujarat and the Jats of Uttar Pradesh – were active in the movement. Being producers of commercial crops, they were very hard hit by the trade depression and falling prices. As their cash income disappeared, they found it impossible to pay the government’s revenue demand. And the refusal of the government to reduce the revenue demand led to widespread resentment. These rich peasants became enthusiastic supporters of the Civil Disobedience Movement, organising their communities, and at times forcing reluctant members, to participate in the boycott programmes. For them the fight for swaraj was a struggle against high revenues. But they were deeply disappointed when the movement was called off in 1931 without the revenue rates being revised. So when the movement was restarted in 1932, many of them refused to participate.\n\nThe poorer peasantry were not just interested in the lowering of the revenue demand. Many of them were small tenants cultivating land they had rented from landlords. As the Depression continued and cash incomes dwindled, the small tenants found it difficult to pay their rent. They wanted the unpaid rent to the landlord to be remitted. They joined a variety of radical movements, often led by Socialists and Communists. Apprehensive of raising issues that might upset the rich peasants and landlords, the Congress was unwilling to support ‘no rent’ campaigns in most places. So the relationship between the poor peasants and the Congress remained uncertain.",

    "text": "Many nationalists thought that the struggle against the British could not be won through non-violence. In 1928, the Hindustan Socialist Republican Army (HSRA) was founded at a meeting in Ferozeshah Kotla ground in Delhi. Amongst its leaders were Bhagat Singh, Jatin Das and Ajoy Ghosh. In a series of dramatic actions in different parts of India, the HSRA targeted some of the symbols of British power. In April 1929, Bhagat Singh and Batukeswar Dutta threw a bomb in the Legislative Assembly. In the same year there was an attempt to blow up the train that Lord Irwin was travelling in. Bhagat Singh was 23 when he was tried and executed by the colonial government. During his trial, Bhagat Singh stated that he did not wish to glorify ‘the cult of the bomb and pistol’ but wanted a revolution in society:\n\n‘Revolution is the inalienable right of mankind. Freedom is the imprescriptible birthright of all. The labourer is the real sustainer of society To the altar of this revolution we have brought our youth as incense, for no sacrifice is too great for so magnificent a cause. We are content. We await the advent of revolution. Inquilab Zindabad!\n\nWhat about the business classes? How did they relate to the Civil Disobedience Movement? During the First World War, Indian merchants and industrialists had made huge profits and become powerful (see Chapter 5). Keen on expanding their business, they now reacted against colonial policies that restricted business activities. They wanted protection against imports of foreign goods, and a rupee-sterling foreign exchange ratio that would discourage imports. To organise business interests, they formed the Indian Industrial and Commercial Congress in 1920 and the Federation of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FICCI) in 1927. Led by prominent industrialists like Purshottamdas Thakurdas and G. D. Birla, the industrialists attacked colonial control over the Indian economy, and supported the Civil Disobedience Movement when it was first launched. They gave financial assistance and refused to buy or sell imported goods. Most businessmen came to see swaraj as a time when colonial restrictions on business would no longer exist and trade and industry would flourish without constraints. But after the failure of the Round Table Conference, business groups were no longer uniformly enthusiastic. They were apprehensive of the spread of militant activities, and worried about prolonged disruption of business, as well as of the growing influence of socialism amongst the younger members of the Congress.",

As the industrialists came closer to the Congress, workers stayed aloof. But in spite of that, some workers did participate in the Civil Disobedience Movement, selectively adopting some of the ideas of the Gandhian programme, like boycott of foreign goods, as part of their own movements against low wages and poor working conditions. There were strikes by railway workers in 1930 and dockworkers in 1932. In 1930 thousands of workers in Chotanagpur tin mines wore Gandhi caps and participated in protest rallies and boycott campaigns. But the Congress was reluctant to include workers’ demands as part of its programme of struggle. It felt that this would alienate industrialists and divide the antiimperial forces.\n\nAnother important feature of the Civil Disobedience Movement was the large-scale participation of women.

    "text": "Why did various classes and groups of Indians participate in the Civil Disobedience Movement?\n\nor the children of God, organised satyagraha to secure them entry into temples, and access to public wells, tanks, roads and schools. He himself cleaned toilets to dignify the work of the bhangi (the sweepers), and persuaded upper castes to change their heart and give up ‘the sin of untouchability’. But many dalit leaders were keen on a different political solution to the problems of the community. They began organising themselves, demanding reserved seats in educational institutions, and a separate electorate that would choose dalit members for legislative councils. Political empowerment, they believed, would resolve the problems of their social disabilities. Dalit participation in the Civil Disobedience Movement was therefore limited, particularly in the Maharashtra and Nagpur region where their organisation was quite strong.\n\nDr B.R. Ambedkar, who organised the dalits into the Depressed Classes Association in 1930, clashed with Mahatma Gandhi at the second Round Table Conference by demanding separate electorates for dalits. When the British government conceded Ambedkar’s demand, Gandhiji began a fast unto death. He believed that separate electorates for dalits would slow down the process of their integration into society. Ambedkar ultimately accepted Gandhiji’s position and the result was the Poona Pact of September 1932. It gave the Depressed Classes (later to be known as the Schedule Castes) reserved seats in provincial and central legislative councils, but they were to be voted in by the general electorate. The dalit movement, however, continued to be apprehensive of the Congressled national movement.\n\nSome of the Muslim political organisations in India were also lukewarm in their response to the Civil Disobedience Movement. After the decline of the Non-Cooperation-Khilafat movement, a large section of Muslims felt alienated from the Congress. From the mid-1920s the Congress came to be more visibly associated with openly Hindu religious nationalist groups like the Hindu Mahasabha. As relations between Hindus and Muslims worsened, each community organised religious processions with militant fervour, provoking Hindu-Muslim communal clashes and riots in various cities. Every riot deepened the distance between the two communities.\n\nThe Congress and the Muslim League made efforts to renegotiate an alliance, and in 1927 it appeared that such a unity could be forged. The important differences were over the question of representation in the future assemblies that were to be elected.

Negotiations over the question of representation continued but all hope of resolving the issue at the All Parties Conference in 1928 disappeared when M.R. Jayakar of the Hindu Mahasabha strongly opposed efforts at compromise.",

    "text": "In 1930, Sir Muhammad Iqbal, as president of the Muslim League, reiterated the importance of separate electorates for the Muslims as an important safeguard for their minority political interests. His statement is supposed to have provided the intellectual justification for the Pakistan demand that came up in subsequent years. This is what he said:\n\n‘I have no hesitation in declaring that if the principle that the Indian Muslim is entitled to full and free development on the lines of his own culture and tradition in his own Indian home-lands is recognised as the basis of a permanent communal settlement, he will be ready to stake his all for the freedom of India. The principle that each group is entitled to free development on its own lines is not inspired by any feeling of narrow communalism … A community which is inspired by feelings of ill-will towards other communities is low and ignoble. I entertain the highest respect for the customs, laws, religions and social institutions of other communities. Nay, it is my duty according to the teachings of the Quran, even to defend their places of worship, if need be. Yet I love the communal group which is the source of life and behaviour and which has formed me what I am by giving me its religion, its literature, its thought, its culture and thereby its whole past as a living operative factor in my present consciousness …\n\n‘Communalism in its higher aspect, then, is indispensable to the formation of a harmonious whole in a country like India. The units of Indian society are not territorial as in European countries … The principle of European democracy cannot be applied to India without recognising the fact of communal groups. The Muslim demand for the creation of a Muslim India within India is, therefore, perfectly justified…\n\n‘The Hindu thinks that separate electorates are contrary to the spirit of true nationalism, because he understands the word “nation” to mean a kind of universal amalgamation in which no communal entity ought to retain its private individuality. Such a state of things, however, does not exist. India is a land of racial and religious variety. Add to this the general economic inferiority of the Muslims, their enormous debt, especially in the Punjab, and their insufficient majorities in some of the provinces, as at present constituted and you will begin to see clearly the meaning of our anxiety to retain separate electorates.’",

Notice how Tilak is surrounded by symbols of unity. The sacred institutions of different faiths (temple, church, masjid) frame the central figure.\n\nNationalism spreads when people begin to believe that they are all part of the same nation, when they discover some unity that binds them together. But how did the nation become a reality in the minds of people? How did people belonging to different communities, regions or language groups develop a sense of collective belonging?\n\nThis sense of collective belonging came partly through the experience of united struggles. But there were also a variety of cultural processes through which nationalism captured people’s imagination. History and fiction, folklore and songs, popular prints and symbols, all played a part in the making of nationalism.\n\nThe identity of the nation, as you know (see Chapter 1), is most often symbolised in a figure or image. This helps create an image with which people can identify the nation. It was in the twentieth century, with the growth of nationalism, that the identity of India came to be visually associated with the image of Bharat Mata. The image was first created by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. In the 1870s he wrote ‘Vande Mataram’ as a hymn to the motherland. Later it was included in his novel Anandamath and widely sung during the Swadeshi movement in Bengal. Moved by the Swadeshi movement, Abanindranath Tagore painted his famous image of Bharat Mata (see Fig. 12). In this painting Bharat Mata is portrayed as an ascetic figure; she is calm, composed, divine and spiritual. In subsequent years, the image of Bharat Mata acquired many different forms, as it circulated in popular prints, and was painted by different artists (see Fig. 14). Devotion to this mother figure came to be seen as evidence of one’s nationalism.\n\nIdeas of nationalism also developed through a movement to revive Indian folklore. In late-nineteenth-century India, nationalists began recording folk tales sung by bards and they toured villages to gather folk songs and legends. These tales, they believed, gave a true picture of traditional culture that had been corrupted and damaged by outside forces. It was essential to preserve this folk tradition in order to discover one’s national identity and restore a sense of pride in one’s past. In Bengal, Rabindranath Tagore himself began collecting ballads, nursery rhymes and myths, and led the movement for folk\n\n![](images/5d234d22cf00e5523fe5cbfc23c79c8a9f30c6a7dd89de9f09ac7523b6d8f47d.jpg)\n\n![](images/07c95da2b4a3e8bdba4d78a656e0729a424dac20aad65e511ac0eefc98d778ab.jpg)  \nFig. 13 – Jawaharlal Nehru, a popular print.\n\nFig. 12 – Bharat Mata, Abanindranath Tagore, 1905.\n\nNotice that the mother figure here is shown as dispensing learning, food and clothing. The mala in one hand emphasises her ascetic quality. Abanindranath Tagore, like Ravi Varma before him, tried to develop a style of painting that could be seen as truly Indian.\n\nNehru is here shown holding the image of Bharat Mata and the map of India close to his heart. In a lot of popular prints, nationalist leaders are shown offering their heads to Bharat Mata. The idea of sacrifice for the mother was powerful within popular imagination.",

    "text": "revival. In Madras, Natesa Sastri published a massive four-volume collection of Tamil folk tales, The Folklore of Southern India. He believed that folklore was national literature; it was ‘the most trustworthy manifestation of people’s real thoughts and characteristics’.\n\nAs the national movement developed, nationalist leaders became more and more aware of such icons and symbols in unifying people and inspiring in them a feeling of nationalism. During the Swadeshi movement in Bengal, a tricolour flag (red, green and yellow) was designed. It had eight lotuses representing eight provinces of British India, and a crescent moon, representing Hindus and Muslims. By 1921, Gandhiji had designed the Swaraj flag. It was again a tricolour (red, green and white) and had a spinning wheel in the centre, representing the Gandhian ideal of self-help. Carrying the flag, holding it aloft, during marches became a symbol of defiance.\n\nAnother means of creating a feeling of nationalism was through reinterpretation of history. By the end of the nineteenth century many Indians began feeling that to instill a sense of pride in the nation, Indian history had to be thought about differently. The British saw Indians as backward and primitive, incapable of governing themselves. In response, Indians began looking into the past to discover India’s great achievements. They wrote about the glorious developments in ancient times when art and architecture, science and mathematics, religion and culture, law and philosophy, crafts and trade had flourished. This glorious time, in their view, was followed by a history of decline, when India was colonised. These nationalist histories urged the readers to take pride in India’s great achievements in the past and struggle to change the miserable conditions of life under British rule.\n\nThese efforts to unify people were not without problems. When the past being glorified was Hindu, when the images celebrated were drawn from Hindu iconography, then people of other communities felt left out.\n\nFig. 14a – Bharat Mata.   \n![](images/8ad08a7a51814bc10204e062f4ea7dd4cd2341957fb84df925122678f824b16b.jpg)  \nThis figure of Bharat Mata is a contrast to the one painted by Abanindranath Tagore.

The Congress under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi tried to channel people’s grievances into organised movements for independence. Through such movements the nationalists tried to forge a national unity. But as we have seen, diverse groups and classes participated in these movements with varied aspirations and expectations. As their\n\ngrievances were wide-ranging, freedom from colonial rule also meant different things to different people. The Congress continuously attempted to resolve differences, and ensure that the demands of one group did not alienate another. This is precisely why the unity within the movement often broke down. The high points of Congress activity and nationalist unity were followed by phases of disunity and inner conflict between groups.\n\nIn other words, what was emerging\n\nwas a nation with many voices wanting freedom from colonial rule.\n\n![](images/45750f5b5254ede6c87d6f5f6e6b2c518acc40041b589e8864acbcd2a85eca6e.jpg)  \nFig. 14b Women’s procession in Bombay during the Quit India Movement",

This led Gandhiji to launch a movement calling for complete withdrawal of the British from India. The Congress Working Committee, in its meeting in Wardha on 14 July 1942, passed the historic ‘Quit India’ resolution demanding the immediate transfer of power to Indians and quit India. On 8 August 1942 in Bombay, the All India Congress Committee endorsed the resolution which called for a non-violent mass struggle on the widest possible scale throughout the country. It was on this occasion that Gandhiji delivered the famous ‘Do or Die’ speech. The call for ‘Quit India’ almost brought the state machinery to a standstill in large parts of the country as people voluntarily threw themselves into the thick of the movement. People observed hartals, and demonstrations and processions were accompanied by national songs and slogans. The movement was truly a mass movement which brought into its ambit thousands of ordinary people, namely students, workers and peasants. It also saw the active participation of leaders, namely, Jayprakash Narayan, Aruna Asaf Ali and Ram Manohar Lohia and many women such as Matangini Hazra in Bengal, Kanaklata Barua in Assam and Rama Devi in Odisha. The British responded with much force, yet it took more than a year to suppress the movement.",

But as you will see in this chapter, the making of the global world has a long history – of trade, of migration, of people in search of work, the movement of capital, and much else. As we think about the dramatic and visible signs of global interconnectedness in our lives today, we need to understand the phases through which this world in which we live has emerged.\n\nAll through history, human societies have become steadily more interlinked. From ancient times, travellers, traders, priests and pilgrims travelled vast distances for knowledge, opportunity and spiritual fulfilment, or to escape persecution. They carried goods, money, values, skills, ideas, inventions, and even germs and diseases. As early as 3000 BCE an active coastal trade linked the Indus valley civilisations with present-day West Asia. For more than a millennia, cowries (the Hindi cowdi or seashells, used as a form of currency) from the Maldives found their way to China and East Africa. The long-distance spread of disease-carrying germs may be traced as far back as the seventh century. By the thirteenth century it had become an unmistakable link.\n\n![](images/646ed7f0dd8c09a97cb410ed3583394a5cd8df1bc7d31fad2aef805c21a84255.jpg)\n\n![](images/57fc9a7053dafb4974c33df83bd121b173e9cadae5894ef5acb0a50b2ea021eb.jpg)  \n1066CH03   \nFig. 1 – Image of a ship on a memorial stone, Goa Museum, tenth century CE.\n\nFrom the ninth century, images of ships appear regularly in memorial stones found in the western coast, indicating the significance of oceanic trade.",

The name ‘silk routes’ points to the importance of West-bound Chinese silk cargoes along this route. Historians have identified several silk routes, over land and by sea, knitting together vast regions of Asia, and linking Asia with Europe and northern Africa. They are known to have existed since before the Christian Era and thrived almost till the fifteenth century. But Chinese pottery also travelled the same route, as did textiles and spices from India and Southeast Asia. In return, precious metals – gold and silver – flowed from Europe to Asia.\n\nTrade and cultural exchange always went hand in hand. Early Christian missionaries almost certainly travelled this route to Asia, as did early Muslim preachers a few centuries later. Much before all this, Buddhism emerged from eastern India and spread in several directions through intersecting points on the silk routes.\n\n![](images/6b9abff8b1ba75472c6f8179010ee00905c75b644b6ba8a5d89a08e0edc1b52c.jpg)  \nFig. 2 – Silk route trade as depicted in a Chinese cave painting, eighth century, Cave 217, Mogao Grottoes, Gansu, China.",

Even ‘ready’ foodstuff in distant parts of the world might share common origins. Take spaghetti and noodles. It is believed\n\nthat noodles travelled west from China to become spaghetti. Or, perhaps Arab traders took pasta to fifth-century Sicily, an island now in Italy. Similar foods were also known in India and Japan, so the truth about their origins may never be known. Yet such guesswork suggests the possibilities of long-distance cultural contact even in the pre-modern world.\n\nMany of our common foods such as potatoes, soya, groundnuts, maize, tomatoes, chillies, sweet potatoes, and so on were not known to our ancestors until about five centuries ago. These foods were only introduced in Europe and Asia after Christopher Columbus accidentally discovered the vast continent that would later become known as the Americas.\n\n![](images/15fa6c72f45b2eb9081648b244956f6334b6645547a3f53615594521706f6e85.jpg)  \nFig. 3 – Merchants from Venice and the Orient exchanging goods, from Marco Polo, Book of Marvels, fifteenth century.\n\n(Here we will use ‘America’ to describe North America, South America and the Caribbean.) In fact, many of our common foods came from America’s original inhabitants – the American Indians.\n\nSometimes the new crops could make the difference between life and death. Europe’s poor began to eat better and live longer with the introduction of the humble potato. Ireland’s poorest peasants became so dependent on potatoes that when disease destroyed the potato crop in the mid-1840s, hundreds of thousands died of starvation.",

    "text": "The pre-modern world shrank greatly in the sixteenth century after European sailors found a sea route to Asia and also successfully crossed the western ocean to America. For centuries before, the Indian Ocean had known a bustling trade, with goods, people, knowledge, customs, etc. criss-crossing its waters. The Indian subcontinent was central to these flows and a crucial point in their networks. The entry of the Europeans helped expand or redirect some of these flows towards Europe.\n\nBefore its ‘discovery’, America had been cut off from regular contact with the rest of the world for millions of years. But from the sixteenth century, its vast lands and abundant crops and minerals began to transform trade and lives everywhere.\n\nPrecious metals, particularly silver, from mines located in presentday Peru and Mexico also enhanced Europe’s wealth and financed its trade with Asia. Legends spread in seventeenth-century Europe about South America’s fabled wealth. Many expeditions set off in search of El Dorado, the fabled city of gold.\n\nThe Portuguese and Spanish conquest and colonisation of America was decisively under way by the mid-sixteenth century. European conquest was not just a result of superior firepower. In fact, the most powerful weapon of the Spanish conquerors was not a conventional military weapon at all. It was the germs such as those of smallpox that they carried on their person. Because of their long isolation, America’s original inhabitants had no immunity against these diseases that came from Europe. Smallpox in particular proved a deadly killer. Once introduced, it spread deep into the continent, ahead even of any Europeans reaching there. It killed and decimated whole communities, paving the way for conquest.\n\n![](images/b0f5cbae290e42e8a42dc83e2c0b51f3ae967af48cc6c01a37c8daec38c9cefa.jpg)  \nFig. 4 – The Irish Potato Famine, Illustrated London News, 1849.\n\nHungry children digging for potatoes in a field that has already been harvested, hoping to discover some leftovers.

The second is the flow of labour – the migration of people in search of employment. The third is the movement of capital for short-term or long-term investments over long distances.\n\nAll three flows were closely interwoven and affected peoples’ lives more deeply now than ever before. The interconnections could sometimes be broken – for example, labour migration was often more restricted than goods or capital flows.

    "text": "A good place to start is the changing pattern of food production and consumption in industrial Europe. Traditionally, countries liked to be self-sufficient in food. But in nineteenth-century Britain, self-sufficiency in food meant lower living standards and social conflict. Why was this so?\n\nPopulation growth from the late eighteenth century had increased the demand for food grains in Britain. As urban centres expanded and industry grew, the demand for agricultural products went up, pushing up food grain prices. Under pressure from landed groups, the government also restricted the import of corn. The laws allowing the government to do this were commonly known as the ‘Corn Laws’. Unhappy with high food prices, industrialists and urban dwellers forced the abolition of the Corn Laws.\n\nAfter the Corn Laws were scrapped, food could be imported into Britain more cheaply than it could be produced within the country. British agriculture was unable to compete with imports. Vast areas of land were now left uncultivated, and thousands of men and women were thrown out of work. They flocked to the cities or migrated overseas.\n\nAs food prices fell, consumption in Britain rose. From the midnineteenth century, faster industrial growth in Britain also led to higher incomes, and therefore more food imports. Around the world – in Eastern Europe, Russia, America and Australia – lands were cleared and food production expanded to meet the British demand.\n\nIt was not enough merely to clear lands for agriculture. Railways were needed to link the agricultural regions to the ports. New harbours had to be built and old ones expanded to ship the new cargoes. People had to settle on the lands to bring them under cultivation. This meant building homes and settlements. All these activities in turn required capital and labour. Capital flowed from financial centres such as London. The demand for labour in places where labour was in short supply – as in America and Australia – led to more migration.\n\nNearly 50 million people emigrated from Europe to America and Australia in the nineteenth century. All over the world some 150 million are estimated to have left their homes, crossed oceans and vast distances over land in search of a better future.\n\n![](images/e31f0d4571510bc36e0fba2ce846c5b0fde7be555ce17df21df2db79050c5140.jpg)  \nFig. 6 – Emigrant ship leaving for the US, by M.W.

Food no longer came from a nearby village or town, but from thousands of miles away. It was not grown by a peasant tilling his own land, but by an agricultural worker, perhaps recently arrived, who was now working on a large farm that only a generation ago had most likely been a forest. It was transported by railway, built for that very purpose, and by ships which were increasingly manned in these decades by low-paid workers from southern Europe, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.",

Here the British Indian government built a network of irrigation canals to transform semi-desert wastes into fertile agricultural lands that could grow wheat and cotton for export. The Canal Colonies, as the areas irrigated by the new canals were called, were settled by peasants from other parts of Punjab.\n\nOf course, food is merely an example. A similar story can be told for cotton, the cultivation of which expanded worldwide to feed British textile mills. Or rubber. Indeed, so rapidly did regional specialisation in the production of commodities develop, that between 1820 and 1914 world trade is estimated to have multiplied 25 to 40 times. Nearly 60 per cent of this trade comprised ‘primary products’ – that is, agricultural products such as wheat and cotton, and minerals such as coal.",

One of the oldest livestock markets in London was at Smithfield. In the midnineteenth century a huge poultry and meat market was established near the railway line connecting Smithfield to all the meat-supplying centres of the country.\n\nThe trade in meat offers a good example of this connected process. Till the 1870s, animals were shipped live from America to Europe and then slaughtered when they arrived there. But live animals took up a lot of ship space. Many also died in voyage, fell ill, lost weight, or became unfit to eat. Meat was hence an expensive luxury beyond the reach of the European poor. High prices in turn kept demand and production down until the development of a new technology, namely, refrigerated ships, which enabled the transport of perishable foods over long distances.\n\nNow animals were slaughtered for food at the starting point – in America, Australia or New Zealand – and then transported to Europe as frozen meat. This reduced shipping costs and lowered meat prices in Europe. The poor in Europe could now consume a more varied diet. To the earlier monotony of bread and potatoes many, though not all, could now add meat (and butter and eggs) to their diet. Better living conditions promoted social peace within the country and support for imperialism abroad.",

This is a good example of the widespread European imperial impact on colonised societies. It shows how in this era of conquest even a disease affecting cattle reshaped the lives and fortunes of thousands of people and their relations with the rest of the world.\n\nHistorically, Africa had abundant land and a relatively small population. For centuries, land and livestock sustained African livelihoods and people rarely worked for a wage. In latenineteenth-century Africa there were few consumer goods that wages could buy. If you had been an African possessing land and livestock – and there was plenty of both – you too would have seen little reason to work for a wage.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, Europeans were attracted to Africa due to its vast resources of land and minerals. Europeans came to Africa hoping to establish plantations and mines to produce crops and minerals for export to Europe. But there was an unexpected problem – a shortage of labour willing to work for wages.\n\nEmployers used many methods to recruit and retain labour. Heavy taxes were imposed which could be paid only by working for wages on plantations and mines. Inheritance laws were changed so that\n\n![](images/df96ca5593367e2f00b87022a903d0990562c890151ffb8116d28be7e5fe6e36.jpg)  \nFig. 12 – Transport to the Transvaal gold mines, The Graphic, 1887.\n\nCrossing the Wilge river was the quickest method of transport to the gold fields of Transvaal. After the discovery of gold in Witwatersrand, Europeans rushed to the region despite their fear of disease and death, and the difficulties of the journey. By the 1890s, South Africa contributed over 20 per cent of the world gold production.\n\n![](images/fce3fd5aaaa1713f83285fa02006b6fcc8c844a2c93b78f41815792962499b1c.jpg)  \nFig. 13 — Diggers at work in the Transvaal gold fields in South Africa, The Graphic, 1875.\n\npeasants were displaced from land: only one member of a family was allowed to inherit land, as a result of which the others were pushed into the labour market. Mineworkers were also confined in compounds and not allowed to move about freely.\n\nThen came rinderpest, a devastating cattle disease.\n\nRinderpest arrived in Africa in the late 1880s. It was carried by infected cattle imported from British Asia to feed the Italian soldiers invading Eritrea in East Africa. Entering Africa in the east, rinderpest moved west ‘like forest fire’, reaching Africa’s Atlantic coast in 1892. It reached the Cape (Africa’s southernmost tip) five years later. Along the way rinderpest killed 90 per cent of the cattle.\n\nThe loss of cattle destroyed African livelihoods. Planters, mine owners and colonial governments now successfully monopolised what scarce cattle resources remained, to strengthen their power and to force Africans into the labour market. Control over the scarce resource of cattle enabled European colonisers to conquer and subdue Africa.\n\nSimilar stories can be told about the impact of Western conquest on other parts of the nineteenth-century world.",

    "text": "The example of indentured labour migration from India also illustrates the two-sided nature of the nineteenth-century world. It was a world of faster economic growth as well as great misery, higher incomes for some and poverty for others, technological advances in some areas and new forms of coercion in others.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, hundreds of thousands of Indian and Chinese labourers went to work on plantations, in mines, and in road and railway construction projects around the world. In India, indentured labourers were hired under contracts which promised return travel to India after they had worked five years on their employer’s plantation.\n\nMost Indian indentured workers came from the present-day regions of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, central India and the dry districts of Tamil Nadu. In the mid-nineteenth century these regions experienced many changes – cottage industries declined, land rents rose, lands were cleared for mines and plantations. All this affected the lives of the poor: they failed to pay their rents, became deeply indebted and were forced to migrate in search of work.",

    "text": "Indentured labour – A bonded labourer under contract to work for an employer for a specific amount of time, to pay off his passage to a new country or home\n\nThe main destinations of Indian indentured migrants were the Caribbean islands (mainly Trinidad, Guyana and Surinam), Mauritius and Fiji. Closer home, Tamil migrants went to Ceylon and Malaya. Indentured workers were also recruited for tea plantations in Assam.\n\nRecruitment was done by agents engaged by employers and paid a small commission. Many migrants agreed to take up work hoping to escape poverty or oppression in their home villages. Agents also tempted the prospective migrants by providing false information about final destinations, modes of travel, the nature of the work, and living and working conditions. Often\n\nmigrants were not even told that they were to embark on a long sea voyage. Sometimes agents even forcibly abducted less willing migrants.\n\nNineteenth-century indenture has been described as a ‘new system of slavery’. On arrival at the plantations, labourers found conditions to be different from what they had imagined. Living and working conditions were harsh, and there were few legal rights.\n\nBut workers discovered their own ways of surviving. Many of them escaped into the wilds, though if caught they faced severe punishment. Others developed new forms of individual and collective selfexpression, blending different cultural forms, old and new. In Trinidad the annual Muharram procession was transformed into a riotous carnival called ‘Hosay’ (for Imam Hussain) in which workers of all races and religions joined. Similarly, the protest religion of Rastafarianism (made famous by the Jamaican reggae star Bob Marley) is also said to reflect social and cultural links with Indian migrants to the Caribbean. ‘Chutney music’, popular in Trinidad and Guyana, is another creative contemporary expression of the post-indenture experience. These forms of cultural fusion are part of the making of the global world, where things from different places get mixed, lose their original characteristics and become something entirely new.\n\nMost indentured workers stayed on after their contracts ended, or returned to their new homes after a short spell in India. Consequently, there are large communities of people of Indian descent in these countries. Have you heard of the Nobel Prize-winning writer\n\n![](images/58887c8ff7e4d4c6f3abec42b36571bb5319c8c1795bce06df079b7353812842.jpg)  \nFig. 14 — Indian indentured labourers in a cocoa plantation in Trinidad, early nineteenth century.",

In a few days I got my hands bruised all over and I could not go to work for a week for which I was prosecuted and sent to jail for 14 days. ... new emigrants find the tasks allotted to them extremely heavy and cannot complete them in a day. ... Deductions are also made from wages if the work is considered to have been done unsatisfactorily. Many people cannot therefore earn their full wages and are punished in various ways.

If we look at the figures of exports from India, we see a steady decline of the share of cotton textiles: from some 30 per cent around 1800 to 15 per cent by 1815. By the 1870s this proportion had dropped to below 3 per cent.\n\nWhat, then, did India export? The figures again tell a dramatic story. While exports of manufactures declined rapidly, export of raw materials increased equally fast. Between 1812 and 1871, the share of raw cotton exports rose from 5 per cent to 35 per cent. Indigo used for dyeing cloth was another important export for\n\n![](images/47240086122aec5137891a6e1d7cb3ec3ce4193dda6181fc6079596a026894e7.jpg)  \nFig. 18 – A distant view of Surat and its river.   \nAll through the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, Surat remained the main centre of overseas trade in the western Indian Ocean.\n\nmany decades. And, as you have read last year, opium shipments to China grew rapidly from the 1820s to become for a while India’s single largest export. Britain grew opium in India and exported it to China and, with the money earned through this sale, it financed its tea and other imports from China.\n\nOver the nineteenth century, British manufactures flooded the Indian market. Food grain and raw material exports from India to Britain and the rest of the world increased. But the value of British exports to India was much higher than the value of British imports from India. Thus Britain had a ‘trade surplus’ with India. Britain used this surplus to balance its trade deficits with other countries – that is, with countries from which Britain was importing more than it was selling to. This is how a multilateral settlement system works – it allows one country’s deficit with another country to be settled by its surplus with a third country. By helping Britain balance its deficits, India played a crucial role in the late-nineteenth-century world economy.",

    "text": "The First World War (1914-18) was mainly fought in Europe. But its impact was felt around the world. Notably for our concerns in this chapter, it plunged the first half of the twentieth century into a crisis that took over three decades to overcome. During this period the world experienced widespread economic and political instability, and another catastrophic war.\n\n### 3.1 Wartime Transformations\n\nThe First World War, as you know, was fought between two power blocs. On the one side were the Allies – Britain, France and Russia (later joined by the US); and on the opposite side were the Central Powers – Germany, Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Turkey. When the war began in August 1914, many governments thought it would be over by Christmas. It lasted more than four years.\n\nThe First World War was a war like no other before. The fighting involved the world’s leading industrial nations which now harnessed the vast powers of modern industry to inflict the greatest possible destruction on their enemies.\n\nThis war was thus the first modern industrial war. It saw the use of machine guns, tanks, aircraft, chemical weapons, etc. on a massive scale. These were all increasingly products of modern large-\n\nscale industry. To fight the war, millions of soldiers had to be recruited from around the world and moved to the frontlines on large ships and trains. The scale of death and destruction – 9 million dead and 20 million injured – was unthinkable before the industrial age, without the use of industrial arms.\n\nMost of the killed and maimed were men of working age. These deaths and injuries reduced the able-bodied workforce in Europe. With fewer numbers within the family, household incomes declined after the war.\n\nDuring the war, industries were restructured to produce war-related goods. Entire societies were also reorganised for war – as men went to battle, women stepped in to undertake jobs that earlier only men were expected to do.\n\n![](images/0ee66997054799c6dba6e9c4c6edb061aa155ae6b883f74b2da7fb7dda1f34d8.jpg)  \nFig. 20 – Workers in a munition factory during the First World War. Production of armaments increased rapidly to meet war demands.\n\nThe war led to the snapping of economic links between some of the world’s largest economic powers which were now fighting each other to pay for them. So Britain borrowed large sums of money from US banks as well as the US public. Thus the war transformed the US from being an international debtor to an international creditor. In other words, at the war’s end, the US and its citizens owned more overseas assets than foreign governments and citizens owned in the US.",

    "text": "Post-war economic recovery proved difficult. Britain, which was the world’s leading economy in the pre-war period, in particular faced a prolonged crisis. While Britain was preoccupied with war, industries had developed in India and Japan. After the war Britain found it difficult to recapture its earlier position of dominance in the Indian market, and to compete with Japan internationally. Moreover, to finance war expenditures Britain had borrowed liberally from the US. This meant that at the end of the war Britain was burdened with huge external debts.\n\nThe war had led to an economic boom, that is, to a large increase in demand, production and employment. When the war boom ended, production contracted and unemployment increased. At the same time the government reduced bloated war expenditures to bring them into line with peacetime revenues. These developments led to huge job losses – in 1921 one in every five British workers was out of work. Indeed, anxiety and uncertainty about work became an enduring part of the post-war scenario.\n\nMany agricultural economies were also in crisis. Consider the case of wheat producers. Before the war, eastern Europe was a major supplier of wheat in the world market. When this supply was disrupted during the war, wheat production in Canada, America and Australia expanded dramatically. But once the war was over, production in eastern Europe revived and created a glut in wheat output. Grain prices fell, rural incomes declined, and farmers fell deeper into debt.",

    "text": "In the US, recovery was quicker. We have already seen how the war helped boost the US economy. After a short period of economic\n\ntrouble in the years after the war, the US economy resumed its strong growth in the early 1920s.\n\nOne important feature of the US economy of the 1920s was mass production. The move towards mass production had begun in the late nineteenth century, but in the 1920s it became a characteristic feature of industrial production in the US. A well-known pioneer of mass production was the car manufacturer Henry Ford. He adapted the assembly line of a Chicago slaughterhouse (in which slaughtered animals were picked apart by butchers as they came down a conveyor belt) to his new car plant in Detroit. He realised that the ‘assembly line’ method would allow a faster and cheaper way of producing vehicles. The assembly line forced workers to repeat a single task mechanically and continuously – such as fitting a particular part to the car – at a pace dictated by the\n\nconveyor belt. This was a way of increasing the output per worker by speeding up the pace of work. Standing in front of a conveyor belt no worker could afford to delay the motions, take a break, or even have a friendly word with a workmate. As a result, Henry Ford’s cars came off the assembly line at three-minute intervals, a speed much faster than that achieved by previous methods. The T-Model Ford was the world’s first mass-produced car.\n\nAt first workers at the Ford factory were unable to cope with the stress of working on assembly lines in which they could not control the pace of work. So they quit in large numbers. In desperation Ford doubled the daily wage to $\\$ 5$ in January 1914. At the same time he banned trade unions from operating in his plants.\n\nHenry Ford recovered the high wage by repeatedly speeding up the production line and forcing workers to work ever harder. So much so, he would soon describe his decision to double the daily wage as the ‘best cost-cutting decision’ he had ever made.\n\nFordist industrial practices soon spread in the US. They were also widely copied in Europe in the 1920s. Mass production lowered costs and prices of engineered goods. Thanks to higher wages, more workers could now afford to purchase durable consumer goods such as cars. Car production in the US rose from 2 million in 1919 to more than 5 million in 1929. Similarly, there was a spurt in the purchase of refrigerators, washing machines, radios, gramophone players, all through a system of ‘hire purchase’ (i.e., on\n\n![](images/03c34614371feeb25bfbe8fae11ba4946f52b29807ab1b9b46b5bec45daa63bf.jpg)  \nFig. 21 – T-Model automobiles lined up outside the factory.\n\ncredit repaid in weekly or monthly instalments). The demand for refrigerators, washing machines, etc. was also fuelled by a boom in house construction and home ownership, financed once again by loans.",

During this period most parts of the world experienced catastrophic declines in production, employment, incomes and trade. The exact timing and impact of the depression varied across countries. But in general, agricultural regions and communities were the worst affected. This was because the fall in agricultural prices was greater and more prolonged than that in the prices of industrial goods.\n\nThe depression was caused by a combination of several factors. We have already seen how fragile the post-war world economy was. First: agricultural overproduction remained a problem. This was made worse by falling agricultural prices. As prices slumped and agricultural incomes declined, farmers tried to expand production and bring a larger volume of produce to the market to maintain their overall income. This worsened the glut in the market, pushing down prices even further. Farm produce rotted for a lack of buyers.\n\nSecond: in the mid-1920s, many countries financed their investments through loans from the US. While it was often extremely easy to raise loans in the US when the going was good, US overseas lenders panicked at the first sign of trouble. In the first half of 1928, US",

Courtesy: Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division.\n\nMany years later, Dorothea Lange, the photographer who shot this picture, recollected the moment of her encounter with the hungry mother:\n\n‘I saw and approached the hungry and desperate mother, as if drawn by a magnet … I did not ask her name or her history. She told me her age, that she was thirty-two. She said that they (i.e., she and her seven children) had been living on frozen vegetables from the surrounding fields, and birds that the children killed … There she sat … with her children huddled around her, and seemed to know that my pictures might help her, and so she helped me …’\n\nFrom: Popular Photography, February 1960.\n\noverseas loans amounted to over $\\$ 1$ billion. A year later it was one quarter of that amount. Countries that depended crucially on US loans now faced an acute crisis.\n\nThe withdrawal of US loans affected much of the rest of the world, though in different ways. In Europe it led to the failure of some major banks and the collapse of currencies such as the British pound sterling. In Latin America and elsewhere it intensified the slump in agricultural and raw material prices. The US attempt to protect its economy in the depression by doubling import duties also dealt another severe blow to world trade.\n\nThe US was also the industrial country most severely affected by the depression. With the fall in prices and the prospect of a depression, US banks had also slashed domestic lending and called back loans. Farms could not sell their harvests, households were ruined, and businesses collapsed. Faced with falling incomes, many households in the US could not repay what they had borrowed, and were forced to give up their homes, cars and other consumer durables. The consumerist prosperity of the 1920s now disappeared in a puff of dust. As unemployment soared, people trudged long distances looking for any work they could find. Ultimately, the US banking system itself collapsed. Unable to recover investments, collect loans and repay depositors, thousands of banks went bankrupt and were forced to close. The numbers are phenomenal: by 1933 over 4,000 banks had closed and between 1929 and 1932 about 110, 000 companies had collapsed.\n\nBy 1935, a modest economic recovery was under way in most industrial countries. But the Great Depression’s wider effects on society, politics and international relations, and on peoples’ minds, proved more enduring.",

    "text": "If we look at the impact of the depression on India we realise how integrated the global economy had become by the early twentieth century. The tremors of a crisis in one part of the world were quickly relayed to other parts, affecting lives, economies and societies worldwide.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, as you have seen, colonial India had become an exporter of agricultural goods and importer of manufactures. The depression immediately affected Indian trade. India’s exports\n\n![](images/17b9f05a2a8a6ae0391fc91843c76fd99d436c505beb928edb3f23b5dd4e4a10.jpg)  \nFig. 23 – People lining up for unemployment benefits, US, photograph by Dorothea Lange, 1938. Courtesy: Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division. When an unemployment census showed 10 million people out of work, the local government in many US states began making small allowances to the unemployed. These long queues came to symbolise the poverty and unemployment of the depression years.\n\nand imports nearly halved between 1928 and 1934. As international prices crashed, prices in India also plunged. Between 1928 and 1934, wheat prices in India fell by 50 per cent.\n\nPeasants and farmers suffered more than urban dwellers. Though agricultural prices fell sharply, the colonial government refused to reduce revenue demands. Peasants producing for the world market were the worst hit.\n\nConsider the jute producers of Bengal. They grew raw jute that was processed in factories for export in the form of gunny bags. But as gunny exports collapsed, the price of raw jute crashed more than 60 per cent. Peasants who borrowed in the hope of better times or to increase output in the hope of higher incomes faced ever lower prices, and fell deeper and deeper into debt. Thus the Bengal jute growers’ lament:\n\ngrow more jute, brothers, with the hope of greater cash.\n\nCosts and debts of jute will make your hopes get dashed.\n\nWhen you have spent all your money and got the crop off the ground,\n\n… traders, sitting at home, will pay only Rs 5 a maund.\n\nAcross India, peasants’ indebtedness increased. They used up their savings, mortgaged lands, and sold whatever jewellery and precious metals they had to meet their expenses. In these depression years, India became an exporter of precious metals, notably gold. The famous economist John Maynard Keynes thought that Indian gold exports promoted global economic recovery. They certainly helped speed up Britain’s recovery, but did little for the Indian peasant. Rural India was thus seething with unrest when Mahatma Gandhi launched the civil disobedience movement at the height of the depression in 1931.\n\nThe depression proved less grim for urban India. Because of falling prices, those with fixed incomes – say town-dwelling landowners who received rents and middle-class salaried employees – now found themselves better off. Everything cost less. Industrial investment also grew as the government extended tariff protection to industries, under the pressure of nationalist opinion.",

It was fought between the Axis powers (mainly Nazi Germany, Japan and Italy) and the Allies (Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the US). It was a war waged for six years on many fronts, in many places, over land, on sea, in the air.\n\nOnce again death and destruction was enormous. At least 60 million people, or about 3 per cent of the world’s 1939 population, are believed to have been killed, directly or indirectly, as a result of the war. Millions more were injured.\n\nUnlike in earlier wars, most of these deaths took place outside the battlefields. Many more civilians than soldiers died from war-related causes. Vast parts of Europe and Asia were devastated, and several cities were destroyed by aerial bombardment or relentless artillery attacks. The war caused an immense amount of economic devastation and social disruption. Reconstruction promised to be long and difficult.\n\n![](images/f63d1d2489c762e25fa9bb77ec7245ea73fcbe3a68fda27b092be854dd2d8026.jpg)  \nFig. 24 – German forces attack Russia, July 1941.

    "text": "Economists and politicians drew two key lessons from inter-war economic experiences. First, an industrial society based on mass production cannot be sustained without mass consumption. But to ensure mass consumption, there was a need for high and stable incomes. Incomes could not be stable if employment was unstable. Thus stable incomes also required steady, full employment.\n\nBut markets alone could not guarantee full employment. Therefore governments would have to step in to minimise\n\nfluctuations of price, output and employment. Economic stability could be ensured only through the intervention of the government.\n\nThe second lesson related to a country’s economic links with the outside world. The goal of full employment could only be achieved if governments had power to control flows of goods, capital and labour.\n\nThus in brief, the main aim of the post-war international economic system was to preserve economic stability and full employment in the industrial world. Its framework was agreed upon at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference held in July 1944 at Bretton Woods in New Hampshire, USA.\n\nThe Bretton Woods conference established the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to deal with external surpluses and deficits of its member nations. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (popularly known as the World Bank) was set up to finance postwar reconstruction. The IMF and the World Bank are referred to as the Bretton Woods institutions or sometimes the Bretton Woods twins. The post-war international economic system is also often described as the Bretton Woods system.\n\nThe IMF and the World Bank commenced financial operations in 1947. Decision-making in these institutions is controlled by the Western industrial powers. The US has an effective right of veto over key IMF and World Bank decisions.\n\nThe international monetary system is the system linking national currencies and monetary system. The Bretton Woods system was based on fixed exchange rates. In this system, national currencies, for example the Indian rupee, were pegged to the dollar at a fixed exchange rate. The dollar itself was anchored to gold at a fixed price of $\\$ 35$ per ounce of gold.",

They were, however, overburdened by poverty and a lack of resources, and their economies and societies were handicapped by long periods of colonial rule.\n\nThe IMF and the World Bank were designed to meet the financial needs of the industrial countries. They were not equipped to cope with the challenge of poverty and lack of development in the former colonies. But as Europe and Japan rapidly rebuilt their economies, they grew less dependent on the IMF and the World Bank. Thus from the late 1950s the Bretton Woods institutions began to shift their attention more towards developing countries.\n\nAs colonies, many of the less developed regions of the world had been part of Western empires. Now, ironically, as newly independent countries facing urgent pressures to lift their populations out of poverty, they came under the guidance of international agencies dominated by the former colonial powers. Even after many years of decolonisation, the former colonial powers still controlled vital resources such as minerals and land in many of their former colonies.\n\nLarge corporations of other powerful countries, for example the US, also often managed to secure rights to exploit developing countries’ natural resources very cheaply.\n\nAt the same time, most developing countries did not benefit from the fast growth the Western economies experienced in the 1950s and 1960s. Therefore they organised themselves as a group – the Group of 77 (or G-77) – to demand a new international economic order (NIEO). By the NIEO they meant a system that would give them real control over their natural resources, more development assistance, fairer prices for raw materials, and better access for their manufactured goods in developed countries’ markets.",

From the 1960s the rising costs of its overseas involvements weakened the US’s finances and competitive strength. The US dollar now no longer commanded confidence as the world’s principal currency. It could not maintain its value in relation to gold. This eventually led to the collapse of the system of fixed exchange rates and the introduction of a system of floating exchange rates.\n\nFrom the mid-1970s the international financial system also changed in important ways. Earlier, developing countries could turn to international institutions for loans and development assistance. But now they were forced to borrow from Western commercial banks and private lending institutions. This led to periodic debt crises in the developing world, and lower incomes and increased poverty, especially in Africa and Latin America.\n\nThe industrial world was also hit by unemployment that began rising from the mid-1970s and remained high until the early 1990s. From the late 1970s MNCs also began to shift production operations to low-wage Asian countries.\n\nChina had been cut off from the post-war world economy since its revolution in 1949. But new economic policies in China and the collapse of the Soviet Union and Soviet-style communism in Eastern Europe brought many countries back into the fold of the world economy.\n\nWages were relatively low in countries like China. Thus they became attractive destinations for investment by foreign MNCs competing to capture world markets. Have you noticed that most of the TVs, mobile phones, and toys we see in the shops seem to be made in China? This is because of the low-cost structure of the Chinese economy, most importantly its low wages.\n\nThe relocation of industry to low-wage countries stimulated world trade and capital flows. In the last two decades the world’s economic geography has been transformed as countries such as India, China and Brazil have undergone rapid economic transformation.",

When we talk of industrial workers we mean factory workers. Histories of industrialisation very often begin with the setting up of the first factories.\n\nThere is a problem with such ideas. Even before factories began to dot the landscape in England and Europe, there was large-scale industrial production for an international market. This was not based on factories. Many historians now refer to this phase of industrialisation as proto-industrialisation.\n\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, merchants from the towns in Europe began moving to the countryside, supplying money to peasants and artisans, persuading them to produce for an international market. With the expansion of world trade and the acquisition of colonies in different parts of the world, the demand for goods began growing. But merchants could not expand production within towns. This was because here urban crafts and trade guilds were powerful. These were associations of producers that trained craftspeople, maintained control over production, regulated competition and prices, and restricted the entry of new people into\n\nthe trade. Rulers granted different guilds the monopoly right to produce and trade in specific products. It was therefore difficult for new merchants to set up business in towns. So they turned to the countryside.\n\nIn the countryside poor peasants and artisans began working for merchants. As you have seen in the textbook last year, this was a time when open fields were disappearing and commons were being enclosed. Cottagers and poor peasants who had earlier depended on common lands for their survival, gathering their firewood, berries, vegetables, hay and straw, had to now look for alternative sources of income. Many had tiny plots of land which could not provide work for all members of the household. So when merchants came around and offered advances to produce goods for them, peasant households eagerly agreed. By working for the merchants, they",

Income from proto-industrial production supplemented their shrinking income from cultivation. It also allowed them a fuller use of their family labour resources.\n\nWithin this system a close relationship developed between the town and the countryside. Merchants were based in towns but the work was done mostly in the countryside. A merchant clothier in England purchased wool from a wool stapler, and carried it to the spinners; the yarn (thread) that was spun was taken in subsequent stages of production to weavers, fullers, and then to dyers. The finishing was done in London before the export merchant sold the cloth in the international market. London in fact came to be known as a finishing centre.\n\nThis proto-industrial system was thus part of a network of commercial exchanges. It was controlled by merchants and the goods were produced by a vast number of producers working within their family farms, not in factories. At each stage of production 20 to 25 workers were employed by each merchant. This meant that each clothier was controlling hundreds of workers.",

    "text": "The earliest factories in England came up by the 1730s. But it was only in the late eighteenth century that the number of factories multiplied.\n\nThe first symbol of the new era was cotton. Its production boomed in the late nineteenth century. In 1760 Britain was importing 2.5 million pounds of raw cotton to feed its cotton industry. By 1787 this import soared to 22 million pounds. This increase was linked to a number of changes within the process of production. Let us look briefly at some of these.\n\nA series of inventions in the eighteenth century increased the efficacy of each step of the production process (carding, twisting and spinning, and rolling). They enhanced the output per worker, enabling each worker to produce more, and they made possible the production of stronger threads and yarn. Then Richard Arkwright created the cotton mill. Till this time, as you have seen, cloth production was spread all over the countryside and carried out within village households. But now, the costly new machines could be purchased, set up and maintained in the mill. Within the mill all the",

    "text": "Look at Figs. 4 and 5. Can you see any difference in the way the two images show industrialisation? Explain your view briefly.\n\nSecond: the new industries could not easily displace traditional industries. Even at the end of the nineteenth century, less than 20 per cent of the total workforce was employed in technologically advanced industrial sectors. Textiles was a dynamic sector, but a large portion of the output was produced not within factories, but outside, within domestic units.\n\nThird: the pace of change in the ‘traditional’ industries was not set by steam-powered cotton or metal industries, but they did not remain entirely stagnant either. Seemingly ordinary and small innovations were the basis of growth in many non-mechanised sectors such as food processing, building, pottery, glass work, tanning, furniture making, and production of implements.\n\nFourth: technological changes occurred slowly. They did not spread dramatically across the industrial landscape. New technology was expensive and merchants and industrialists were cautious about using it. The machines often broke down and repair was costly. They were not as effective as their inventors and manufacturers claimed.\n\nConsider the case of the steam engine. James Watt improved the steam engine produced by Newcomen and patented the new engine in 1781. His industrialist friend Mathew Boulton manufactured the new model. But for years he could find no buyers. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, there were no more than 321 steam engines\n\nall over England. Of these, 80 were\n\nin cotton industries, nine in wool industries, and the rest in mining, canal works and iron works. Steam engines were not used in any of the other industries till much later in the century. So even the most powerful new technology that enhanced the productivity of labour manifold was slow to be accepted by industrialists.\n\nHistorians now have come to increasingly recognise that the typical worker in the mid-nineteenth century was not a machine operator but the traditional craftsperson and labourer.\n\n![](images/468a7be24a6537b9b98696d000a0507b49ce077de7367a6fd71b19b6cc6db7ec.jpg)  \nFig. 6 – A fitting shop at a railway works in England, The Illustrated London News, 1849.

    "text": "In Victorian Britain there was no shortage of human labour. Poor peasants and vagrants moved to the cities in large numbers in search of jobs, waiting for work. As you will know, when there is plenty of labour, wages are low. So industrialists had no problem of labour shortage or high wage costs. They did not want to introduce machines that got rid of human labour and required large capital investment.\n\nIn many industries the demand for labour was seasonal. Gas works and breweries were especially busy through the cold months. So they needed more workers to meet their peak demand. Bookbinders and printers, catering to Christmas demand, too needed extra hands before December. At the waterfront, winter was the time that ships were repaired and spruced up. In all such industries where production fluctuated with the season, industrialists usually preferred hand labour, employing workers for the season.\n\n![](images/bbee28aae8162dbfdcc2437356325dd2482ec3311946b7617e11d93ad19d8bba.jpg)  \nFig. 8 – People on the move in search of work, The Illustrated London News, 1879.\n\nSome people were always on the move selling small goods and looking for temporary work.\n\nA range of products could be produced only with hand labour.

With two friends I started out to walk the journey, filled with the hope that we would be able to obtain employment, when we get there, with the kind assistance of my friend … we had little money when we started, not enough to pay for our food and lodgings each night until we arrived in London.

Our money was gone, so there was nothing for us to do but to walk around until late at night, and then try to find some place to sleep. We found an old building and slept in it that night. The next day, Sunday, late in the afternoon, we got to the Old Kent Gas Works, and applied for work. To my great surprise, the man we had been looking for was working at the time.

This painting shows the homeless in London applying for tickets to stay overnight in a workhouse. These shelters were maintained under the supervision of the Poor Law Commissioners for the ‘destitute, wayfarers, wanderers and foundling’. Staying in these workhouses was a humiliating experience: everyone was subjected to a medical examination to see whether they were carrying disease, their bodies were cleansed, and their clothes purified. They had to also do hard labour.\n\nshelters. Some stayed in Night Refuges that were set up by private individuals; others went to the Casual Wards maintained by the Poor Law authorities.\n\nSeasonality of work in many industries meant prolonged periods without work. After the busy season was over, the poor were on the streets again. Some returned to the countryside after the winter, when the demand for labour in the rural areas opened up in places. But most looked for odd jobs, which till the mid-nineteenth century were difficult to find.\n\nWages increased somewhat in the early nineteenth century. But they tell us little about the welfare of the workers. The average figures hide the variations between trades and the fluctuations from year to year. For instance, when prices rose sharply during the prolonged Napoleonic War, the real value of what the workers earned fell significantly, since the same wages could now buy fewer things. Moreover, the income of workers depended not on the wage rate alone. What was also critical was the period of employment: the number of days of work determined the average daily income of the workers. At the best of times till the mid-nineteenth century, about 10 per cent of the urban population were extremely poor. In periods of economic slump, like the 1830s, the proportion of unemployed went up to anything between 35 and 75 per cent in different regions.\n\nThe fear of unemployment made workers hostile to the introduction of new technology.

    "text": "Let us now move to India to see how a colony industrialises. Once again we will look not only at factory industries but also at the non-mechanised sector. We will limit our discussion primarily to textile industries.\n\n### 3.1 The Age of Indian Textiles\n\nBefore the age of machine industries, silk and cotton goods from India dominated the international market in textiles. Coarser cottons were produced in many countries, but the finer varieties often came from India. Armenian and Persian merchants took the goods from Punjab to Afghanistan, eastern Persia and Central Asia. Bales of fine textiles were carried on camel back via the north-west frontier, through mountain passes and across deserts. A vibrant sea trade operated through the main pre-colonial ports. Surat on the Gujarat coast connected India to the Gulf and Red Sea Ports; Masulipatam on the Coromandel coast and Hoogly in Bengal had trade links with Southeast Asian ports.\n\nA variety of Indian merchants and bankers were involved in this network of export trade – financing production, carrying goods and supplying exporters. Supply merchants linked the port towns to the inland regions. They gave advances to weavers, procured the woven cloth from weaving villages, and carried the supply to the ports. At the port, the big shippers and export merchants had brokers who negotiated the price and bought goods from the supply merchants operating inland.\n\nBy the 1750s this network, controlled by Indian merchants, was breaking down.\n\nThe European companies gradually gained power – first securing a variety of concessions from local courts, then the monopoly rights to trade. This resulted in a decline of the old ports of Surat and Hoogly through which local merchants had operated. Exports from these ports fell dramatically, the credit that had financed the earlier trade began drying up, and the local bankers slowly went bankrupt. In the last years of the seventeenth century, the gross value of trade that passed through Surat had been Rs 16 million. By the 1740s it had slumped to Rs 3 million.",

    "text": "The consolidation of East India Company power after the 1760s did not initially lead to a decline in textile exports from India. British cotton industries had not yet expanded and Indian fine textiles were in great demand in Europe. So the company was keen on expanding textile exports from India.\n\nBefore establishing political power in Bengal and Carnatic in the 1760s and 1770s, the East India Company had found it difficult to ensure a regular supply of goods for export. The French, Dutch,\n\n![](images/c87d6c4707ea8450e79371118e29c4256661fffeddc0a4c70f136d3786215e39.jpg)  \nFig. 14 – A weaver at work, Gujarat.\n\nPortuguese as well as the local traders competed in the market to secure woven cloth. So the weaver and supply merchants could bargain and try selling the produce to the best buyer. In their letters back to London, Company officials continuously complained of difficulties of supply and the high prices.\n\nHowever, once the East India Company established political power, it could assert a monopoly right to trade. It proceeded to develop a system of management and control that would eliminate competition, control costs, and ensure regular supplies of cotton and silk goods. This it did through a series of steps.\n\nFirst: the Company tried to eliminate the existing traders and brokers connected with the cloth trade, and establish a more direct control over the weaver. It appointed a paid servant called the gomastha to supervise weavers, collect supplies, and examine the quality of cloth.\n\nSecond: it prevented Company weavers from dealing with other buyers. One way of doing this was through the system of advances. Once an order was placed, the weavers were given loans to purchase the raw material for their production. Those who took loans had to hand over the cloth they produced to the gomastha. They could not take it to any other trader.\n\nAs loans flowed in and the demand for fine textiles expanded, weavers eagerly took the advances, hoping to earn more. Many weavers had small plots of land which they had earlier cultivated along with weaving, and the produce from this took care of their family needs. Now they had to lease out the land and devote all their time to weaving. Weaving, in fact, required the labour of the entire family, with children and women all engaged in different stages of the process.\n\nSoon, however, in many weaving villages there were reports of clashes between weavers and gomasthas. Earlier supply merchants had very often lived within the weaving villages, and had a close relationship with the weavers, looking after their needs and helping them in times of crisis. The new gomasthas were outsiders, with no long-term social link with the village. They acted arrogantly, marched into villages with sepoys and peons, and punished weavers for delays in supply – often beating and flogging them. The weavers lost the space to bargain for prices and sell to different buyers: the price they received from the Company was miserably low and the loans they had accepted tied them to the Company.",

    "text": "In 1772, Henry Patullo, a Company official, had ventured to say that the demand for Indian textiles could never reduce, since no other nation produced goods of the same quality. Yet by the beginning of the nineteenth century we see the beginning of a long decline of textile exports from India. In 1811-12 piece-goods accounted for 33 per cent of India’s exports; by 1850-51 it was no more than 3 per cent.\n\nWhy did this happen? What were its implications?\n\nAs cotton industries developed in England, industrial groups began worrying about imports from other countries. They pressurised the government to impose import duties on cotton textiles so that Manchester goods could sell in Britain without facing any competition from outside. At the same time industrialists persuaded the East India Company to sell British manufactures in Indian markets as well. Exports of British cotton goods increased dramatically in the early nineteenth century. At the end of the eighteenth century there had been virtually no import of cotton piece-goods into India. But by 1850 cotton piece-goods constituted over 31 per cent of the value of Indian imports; and by the 1870s this figure was over 50 per cent.\n\nCotton weavers in India thus faced two problems at the same time: their export market collapsed, and the local market shrank, being glutted with Manchester imports. Produced by machines at lower costs, the imported cotton goods were so cheap that weavers could not easily compete with them. By the 1850s, reports from most weaving regions of India narrated stories of decline and desolation.\n\nBy the 1860s, weavers faced a new problem. They could not get sufficient supply of raw cotton of good quality. When the American",

    "text": "Industries were set up in different regions by varying sorts of people. Let us see who they were.\n\nThe history of many business groups goes back to trade with China. From the late eighteenth century, as you have read in your book last year, the British in India began exporting opium to China and took tea from China to England. Many Indians became junior players in this trade, providing finance, procuring supplies, and shipping consignments. Having earned through trade, some of these businessmen had visions of developing industrial enterprises in India. In Bengal, Dwarkanath Tagore made his fortune in the China trade before he turned to industrial investment, setting up six joint-stock companies in the 1830s and 1840s. Tagore’s enterprises sank along with those of others in the wider business crises of the 1840s, but later in the nineteenth century many of the China traders became successful industrialists. In Bombay, Parsis like Dinshaw Petit and Jamsetjee Nusserwanjee Tata who built huge industrial empires in India, accumulated their initial wealth partly from exports to China, and partly from raw cotton shipments to England. Seth Hukumchand, a Marwari businessman who set up the first Indian jute mill in Calcutta in 1917, also traded with China. So did the father as well as grandfather of the famous industrialist G.D. Birla.\n\nCapital was accumulated through other trade networks. Some merchants from Madras traded with Burma while others had links with the Middle East and East Africa. There were yet other\n\n![](images/61d3197c514d2414ca1ffd0e05ce0aed6fe82d1c6321b2e4c798d95fb305b6f3.jpg)  \nFig. 16 – Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy. Jeejeebhoy was the son of a Parsi weaver. Like many others of his time, he was involved in the China trade and shipping. He owned a large fleet of ships, but competition from English and American shippers forced him to sell his ships by the 1850s.\n\n![](images/cff022c514993cadd3f749b5e6e261a7634bb0cecef1a967be231ea5bd6d7cce.jpg)  \nFig. 17 – Dwarkanath Tagore. Dwarkanath Tagore believed that India would develop through westernisation and industrialisation. He invested in shipping, shipbuilding, mining, banking, plantations and insurance.\n\ncommercial groups, but they were not directly involved in external trade. They operated within India, carrying goods from one place to another, banking money, transferring funds between cities, and financing traders. When opportunities of investment in industries opened up, many of them set up factories.\n\nAs colonial control over Indian trade tightened, the space within which Indian merchants could function became increasingly limited. They were barred from trading with Europe in manufactured goods, and had to export mostly raw materials and food grains – raw cotton, opium, wheat and indigo – required by the British. They were also gradually edged out of the shipping business.\n\nTill the First World War, European Managing Agencies in fact controlled a large sector of Indian industries. Three of the biggest ones were Bird Heiglers & Co., Andrew Yule, and Jardine Skinner & Co. These Agencies mobilised capital, set up joint-stock companies and managed them. In most instances Indian financiers provided the capital while the European Agencies made all investment and business decisions. The European merchant-industrialists had their own chambers of commerce which Indian businessmen were not allowed to join.",

    "text": "Factories needed workers. With the expansion of factories, this demand increased. In 1901, there were 584,000 workers in Indian factories. By 1946 the number was over 2,436, 000. Where did the workers come from?\n\nIn most industrial regions workers came from the districts around. Peasants and artisans who found no work in the village went to the industrial centres in search of work. Over 50 per cent workers in the Bombay cotton industries in 1911 came from the neighbouring district of Ratnagiri, while the mills of Kanpur got most of their textile hands from the villages within the district of Kanpur. Most often millworkers moved between the village and the city, returning to their village homes during harvests and festivals.\n\nOver time, as news of employment spread, workers travelled great distances in the hope of work in the mills. From the United Provinces, for instance, they went to work in the textile mills of Bombay and in the jute mills of Calcutta.\n\n![](images/389bd6697ca3a9beb1d0702d468744aed8e255b2233ce7f306e2ba91788857a4.jpg)  \nFig. 19 – Young workers of a Bombay mill, early twentieth century. When workers went back to their village homes, they liked dressing up.\n\nGetting jobs was always difficult, even when mills multiplied and the demand for workers increased. The numbers seeking work were always more than the jobs available. Entry into the mills was also restricted. Industrialists usually employed a jobber to get new recruits. Very often the jobber was an old and trusted worker. He got people from his village, ensured them jobs, helped them settle in the city and provided them money in times of crisis. The jobber therefore became a person with some authority and power. He began demanding money and gifts for his favour and controlling the lives of workers.\n\nThe number of factory workers increased over time. However, as you will see, they were a small proportion of the total industrial workforce.",

    "text": "European Managing Agencies, which dominated industrial production in India, were interested in certain kinds of products. They established tea and coffee plantations, acquiring land at cheap rates from the colonial government; and they invested in mining, indigo and jute. Most of these were products required primarily for export trade and not for sale in India.\n\nWhen Indian businessmen began setting up industries in the late nineteenth century, they avoided competing with Manchester goods in the Indian market. Since yarn was not an important part of British imports into India, the early cotton mills in India produced coarse cotton yarn (thread) rather than fabric. When yarn was imported it was only of the superior variety. The yarn produced in Indian spinning mills was used by handloom weavers in India or exported to China.\n\nBy the first decade of the twentieth century a series of changes affected the pattern of industrialisation. As the swadeshi movement gathered momentum, nationalists mobilised people to boycott foreign cloth. Industrial groups organised themselves to protect their collective interests, pressurising the government to increase tariff protection and grant other concessions. From 1906, moreover, the export of Indian yarn to China declined since produce from Chinese and\n\nJapanese mills flooded the Chinese market. So industrialists in India began shifting from yarn to cloth production. Cotton piecegoods production in India doubled between 1900 and 1912.\n\nYet, till the First World War, industrial growth was slow. The war created a dramatically new situation. With British mills busy with war production to meet the needs of the army, Manchester imports into India declined. Suddenly, Indian mills had a vast home market to supply. As the war prolonged, Indian factories were called upon to supply war needs: jute bags, cloth for army uniforms, tents and leather boots, horse and mule saddles and a host of other items. New factories were set up and old\n\n![](images/c225d380d2b64e52726e8154980466b9b52241783f5f8e4a688fae31c4bee07c.jpg)  \nFig. 22 – The first office of the Madras Chamber of Commerce. By the late nineteenth century merchants in different regions began meeting and forming Chambers of Commerce to regulate business and decide on issues of collective concern.\n\nones ran multiple shifts. Many new workers were employed and everyone was made to work longer hours. Over the war years industrial production boomed.\n\nAfter the war, Manchester could never recapture its old position in the Indian market. Unable to modernise and compete with the US, Germany and Japan, the economy of Britain crumbled after the war. Cotton production collapsed and exports of cotton cloth from Britain fell dramatically. Within the colonies, local industrialists gradually consolidated their position, substituting foreign manufactures and capturing the home market.",

    "text": "While factory industries grew steadily after the war, large industries formed only a small segment of the economy. Most of them – about 67 per cent in 1911 – were located in Bengal and Bombay. Over the rest of the country, small-scale production continued to predominate. Only a small proportion of the total industrial labour force worked in registered factories: 5 per cent in 1911 and 10 per cent in 1931. The rest worked in small workshops and household units, often located in alleys and bylanes, invisible to the passer-by.\n\nIn fact, in some instances, handicrafts production actually expanded in the twentieth century. This is true even in the case of the handloom sector that we have discussed. While cheap machine-made thread wiped out the spinning industry in the nineteenth century, the weavers survived, despite problems. In the twentieth century, handloom cloth production expanded steadily: almost trebling between 1900 and 1940.\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nThis was partly because of technological changes. Handicrafts people adopt new technology if that helps them improve production without excessively pushing up costs. So, by the second decade of the twentieth century we find weavers using looms with a fly shuttle. This increased productivity per worker, speeded up production and reduced labour demand. By 1941, over 35 per cent of handlooms in India were fitted with fly shuttles: in regions like Travancore, Madras, Mysore, Cochin, Bengal the proportion was 70 to 80 per cent. There were several other small innovations that helped weavers improve their productivity and compete with the mill sector.\n\n![](images/cef6c5056fc3fbaa6acb9aaef73cee97716a7d9ca00c59828da4bad8fd702ad8.jpg)  \nFig. 23 – A Hand-woven Cloth.\n\nThe intricate designs of hand-woven cloth could not be easily copied by the mills.",

    "text": "Fly shuttle – It is a mechanical device used for weaving, moved by means of ropes and pullies. It places the horizontal threads ( called the weft) into the verticle threads (called the warp). The invention of the fly shuttle made it possible for weavers to operate large looms and weave wide pieces of cloth.\n\nCertain groups of weavers were in a better position than others to survive the competition with mill industries. Amongst weavers some produced coarse cloth while others wove finer varieties. The coarser cloth was bought by the poor and its demand fluctuated violently. In times of bad harvests and famines, when the rural poor had little to eat, and their cash income disappeared, they could not possibly buy cloth. The demand for the finer varieties bought by the well-to-do was more stable. The rich could buy these even when the poor starved. Famines did not affect the sale of Banarasi or Baluchari saris. Moreover, as you have seen, mills could not imitate specialised weaves. Saris with woven borders, or the famous lungis and handkerchiefs of Madras, could not be easily displaced by mill production.\n\nWeavers and other craftspeople who continued to expand production through the twentieth century, did not necessarily prosper. They lived hard lives and worked long hours. Very often the entire household – including all the women and children – had to work at various stages of the production process. But they were not simply remnants of past times in the age of factories. Their life and labour was integral to the process of industrialisation.\n\n![](images/84408c132b768e9c40905a646cb6b084aa7c973a38d9925cdb110410875198b2.jpg)  \nFig. 24 – Location of large-scale industries in India, 1931.

    "text": "We have seen how British manufacturers attempted to take over the Indian market, and how Indian weavers and craftsmen, traders and industrialists resisted colonial controls, demanded tariff protection, created their own spaces, and tried to extend the market for their produce.\n\nBut when new products are produced people have to be persuaded to buy them. They have to feel like using the product. How was this done?\n\nOne way in which new consumers are created is through advertisements. As you know, advertisements make products appear desirable and necessary. They try to shape the minds of people and create new needs. Today we live in a world where advertisements surround us. They appear in newspapers, magazines, hoardings, street walls, television screens. But if we look back into history we find that from the very beginning of the industrial age, advertisements have played a part in expanding the markets for products, and in shaping a new consumer culture.\n\nWhen Manchester industrialists began selling cloth in India, they put labels on the cloth bundles. The label was needed to make the place of manufacture and the name of the company familiar to the buyer. The label was also to be a mark of quality. When buyers saw ‘MADE IN MANCHESTER’ written in bold on the label, they were expected to feel confident about buying the cloth.\n\n![](images/12723ff688c525cab05b03dc6f6ebd9c885f6da3c897946b3b05b2aeb9a3d791.jpg)  \nFig. 25 – Gripe Water calendar of 1928 by M.V.

They also carried images and were very often beautifully illustrated. If we look at these old labels, we can have some idea of the mind of the manufacturers, their calculations, and the way they appealed to the people.\n\nImages of Indian gods and goddesses regularly appeared on these labels. It was as if the association with gods gave divine approval to the goods being sold. The imprinted image of Krishna or Saraswati was also intended to make the manufacture from a foreign land appear somewhat familiar to Indian people.\n\nBy the late nineteenth century, manufacturers were printing calendars to popularise their products. Unlike newspapers and magazines, calendars were used even by people who could not read. They were hung in tea shops and in poor people’s homes just as much as in offices and middle-class apartments. And those who hung the calendars had to see the advertisements, day after day, through the year. In these calendars, once again, we see the figures of gods being used to sell new products.",

We find evidence of print everywhere around us – in books, journals, newspapers, prints of famous paintings, and also in everyday things like theatre programmes, official circulars, calendars, diaries, advertisements, cinema posters at street corners. We read printed literature, see printed images, follow the news through newspapers, and track public debates that appear in print. We take for granted this world of print and often forget that there was a time before print. We may not realise that print itself has a history which has, in fact, shaped our contemporary world. What is this history? When did printed literature begin to circulate? How has it helped create the modern world?\n\nIn this chapter we will look at the development of print, from its beginnings in East Asia to its expansion in Europe and in India. We will understand the impact of the spread of technology and consider how social lives and cultures changed with the coming of print.\n\n![](images/3a25f7e1bbb5f5ee48b3103a6147efbb381b84e0a70bd2a0c7f75fd1e0327cdc.jpg)  \nFig. 1 – Book making before the age of print, from Akhlaq-i-Nasiri, 1595.\n\nThis is a royal workshop in the sixteenth century, much before printing began in India.

    "text": "The earliest kind of print technology was developed in China, Japan and Korea. This was a system of hand printing. From AD 594 onwards, books in China were printed by rubbing paper – also invented there – against the inked surface of woodblocks. As both sides of the thin, porous sheet could not be printed, the traditional Chinese ‘accordion book’ was folded and stitched at the side. Superbly skilled craftsmen could duplicate, with remarkable accuracy, the beauty of calligraphy.\n\nThe imperial state in China was, for a very long time, the major producer of printed material. China possessed a huge bureaucratic system which recruited its personnel through civil service examinations. Textbooks for this examination were printed in vast numbers under the sponsorship of the imperial state. From the sixteenth century, the number of examination candidates went up and that increased the volume of print.\n\nBy the seventeenth century, as urban culture bloomed in China, the uses of print diversified. Print was no longer used just by scholarofficials. Merchants used print in their everyday life, as they collected trade information. Reading increasingly became a leisure activity. The new readership preferred fictional narratives, poetry, autobiographies, anthologies of literary masterpieces, and romantic plays. Rich women began to read, and many women began publishing their poetry and plays. Wives of scholar-officials published their works and courtesans wrote about their lives.\n\nThis new reading culture was accompanied by a new technology. Western printing techniques and mechanical presses were imported in the late nineteenth century as Western powers established their outposts in China. Shanghai became the hub of the new print culture, catering to the Western-style schools. From hand printing there was now a gradual shift to mechanical printing.",

These prints travelled to contemporary US and Europe and influenced artists like Manet, Monet and Van Gogh. Publishers like Tsutaya Juzaburo identified subjects and commissioned artists who drew the theme in outline.

    "text": "For centuries, silk and spices from China flowed into Europe through the silk route. In the eleventh century, Chinese paper reached Europe via the same route. Paper made possible the production of manuscripts, carefully written by scribes. Then, in 1295, Marco Polo, a great explorer, returned to Italy after many years of exploration in China. As you read above, China already had the technology of woodblock printing. Marco Polo brought this knowledge back with him. Now Italians began producing books with woodblocks, and soon the technology spread to other parts of Europe. Luxury editions were still handwritten on very expensive vellum, meant for aristocratic circles and rich monastic libraries which scoffed at printed books as cheap vulgarities. Merchants and students in the university towns bought the cheaper printed copies.\n\nAs the demand for books increased, booksellers all over Europe began exporting books to many different countries. Book fairs were held at different places. Production of handwritten manuscripts was also organised in new ways to meet the expanded demand. Scribes or skilled handwriters were no longer solely employed by wealthy or influential patrons but increasingly by booksellers as well. More than 50 scribes often worked for one bookseller.\n\nBut the production of handwritten manuscripts could not satisfy the ever-increasing demand for books. Copying was an expensive, laborious and time-consuming business. Manuscripts were fragile, awkward to handle, and could not be carried around or read easily. Their circulation therefore remained limited. With the growing demand for books, woodblock printing gradually became more and more popular. By the early fifteenth century, woodblocks were being widely used in Europe to print textiles, playing cards, and religious pictures with simple, brief texts.\n\nThere was clearly a great need for even quicker and cheaper reproduction of texts. This could only be with the invention of a new print technology. The breakthrough occurred at Strasbourg, Germany, where Johann Gutenberg developed the first-known printing press in the 1430s.",

Write a letter from China to describe the world of print which you have seen there.\n\n### 2.1 Gutenberg and the Printing Press\n\nGutenberg was the son of a merchant and grew up on a large agricultural estate. From his childhood he had seen wine and olive presses. Subsequently, he learnt the art of polishing stones, became a master goldsmith, and also acquired the expertise to create lead moulds used for making trinkets. Drawing on this knowledge, Gutenberg adapted existing technology to design his innovation. The olive press provided the model for the printing press, and moulds were used for casting the metal types for the letters of the alphabet. By 1448, Gutenberg perfected the system. The first book he printed was the Bible. About 180 copies were printed and it took three years to produce them. By the standards of the time this was fast production.\n\nThe new technology did not entirely displace the existing art of producing books by hand.\n\nIn fact, printed books at first closely resembled the written manuscripts in appearance and layout. The metal letters imitated the ornamental handwritten styles. Borders were illuminated by hand with foliage and other patterns, and illustrations were painted. In the books printed for the rich, space for decoration was kept blank on the printed page. Each purchaser could choose the design and decide on the painting school that would do the illustrations.\n\nIn the hundred years between 1450 and 1550, printing presses were set up in most countries of Europe. Printers from Germany travelled to other countries, seeking work and helping start new presses. As the number of printing presses grew, book production boomed. The second half of the fifteenth century saw 20 million copies of printed books flooding the markets in Europe. The number went up in the sixteenth century to about 200 million copies.\n\nThis shift from hand printing to mechanical printing led to the print revolution.",

At one time it used to be a wooden board; later it was made of steel\n\n![](images/b765a85ed2c0c40108d161b054dd3a7665ecfdfc3f2df99d94a6cdb81f67972d.jpg)  \nFig. 5 – A Portrait of Johann Gutenberg, 1584.\n\n![](images/0df5357b6be58519428f8e16a046d25a5ccf5f3e96171b24258c6cd8003b310d.jpg)  \nFig. 6 – Gutenberg Printing Press.\n\nNotice the long handle attached to the screw. This handle was used to turn the screw and press down the platen over the printing block that was placed on top of a sheet of damp paper. Gutenberg developed metal types for each of the 26 characters of the Roman alphabet and devised a way of moving them around so as to compose different words of the text. This came to be known as the moveable type printing machine, and it remained the basic print technology over the next 300 years. Books could now be produced much faster than was possible when each print block was prepared by carving a piece of wood by hand. The Gutenberg press could print 250 sheets on one side per hour.\n\n![](images/aa6bd6d8a76a46e38f434a2f35401479792e59548899546050f70c99c6c5aa00.jpg)  \nFig. 7 – Pages of Gutenberg’s Bible, the first printed book in Europe.\n\nGutenberg printed about 180 copies, of which no more than 50 have survived.\n\nLook at these pages of Gutenberg’s Bible carefully. They were not just products of new technology. The text was printed in the new Gutenberg press with metal type, but the borders were carefully designed, painted and illuminated by hand by artists. No two copies were the same. Every page of each copy was different. Even when two copies look similar, a careful comparison will reveal differences. Elites everywhere preferred this lack of uniformity: what they possessed then could be claimed as unique, for no one else owned a copy that was exactly the same.\n\nIn the text you will notice the use of colour within the letters in various places. This had two functions: it added colour to the page, and highlighted all the holy words to emphasise their significance. But the colour on every page of the text was added by hand. Gutenberg printed the text in black, leaving spaces where the colour could be filled in later.\n\n![](images/c16790410797b250b7c62d3ddb42cd53aea5f34b4624093b30fb52ab36994e34.jpg)  \nFig. 8 – A printer’s workshop, sixteenth century.\n\nThis picture depicts what a printer’s shop looked like in the sixteenth century.

    "text": "What was the print revolution? It was not just a development, a new way of producing books; it transformed the lives of people, changing their relationship to information and knowledge, and with institutions and authorities. It influenced popular perceptions and opened up new ways of looking at things.\n\nLet us explore some of these changes.\n\n### 3.1 A New Reading Public\n\nWith the printing press, a new reading public emerged. Printing reduced the cost of books. The time and labour required to produce each book came down, and multiple copies could be produced with greater ease. Books flooded the market, reaching out to an ever-growing readership.\n\nAccess to books created a new culture of reading. Earlier, reading was restricted to the elites. Common people lived in a world of oral culture. They heard sacred texts read out, ballads recited, and folk tales narrated. Knowledge was transferred orally. People collectively heard a story, or saw a performance. As you will see in Chapter 8, they did not read a book individually and silently. Before the age of print, books were not only expensive but they could not be produced in sufficient numbers. Now books could reach out to wider sections of people. If earlier there was a hearing public, now a reading public came into being.\n\nBut the transition was not so simple. Books could be read only by the literate, and the rates of literacy in most European countries were very low till the twentieth century. How, then, could publishers persuade the common people to welcome the printed book? To do this, they had to keep in mind the wider reach of the printed work: even those who did not read could certainly enjoy listening to books being read out. So printers began publishing popular ballads and folk tales, and such books would be profusely illustrated with pictures. These were then sung and recited at gatherings in villages and in taverns in towns.\n\nOral culture thus entered print and printed material was orally transmitted. The line that separated the oral and reading cultures became blurred. And the hearing public and reading public became intermingled.",

Even those who disagreed with established authorities could now print and circulate their ideas. Through the printed message, they could persuade people to think differently, and move them to action. This had significance in different spheres of life.\n\nNot everyone welcomed the printed book, and those who did also had fears about it. Many were apprehensive of the effects that the easier access to the printed word and the wider circulation of books, could have on people’s minds. It was feared that if there was no control over what was printed and read then rebellious and irreligious thoughts might spread. If that happened the authority of ‘valuable’ literature would be destroyed. Expressed by religious authorities and monarchs, as well as many writers and artists, this anxiety was the basis of widespread criticism of the new printed literature that had begun to circulate.\n\nLet us consider the implication of this in one sphere of life in early modern Europe – namely, religion.\n\nIn 1517, the religious reformer Martin Luther wrote Ninety Five Theses criticising many of the practices and rituals of the Roman Catholic Church. A printed\n\ncopy of this was posted on a church door in Wittenberg. It challenged the Church to debate his ideas. Luther’s writings were immediately reproduced in vast numbers and read widely. This lead to a division within the Church and to the beginning of the Protestant\n\nReformation. Luther’s translation of the New Testament sold 5,000 copies within a few weeks and a second edition appeared within three months. Deeply grateful to print, Luther said, ‘Printing is the ultimate gift of God and the greatest one.’ Several scholars, in fact, think that print brought about a new intellectual atmosphere and helped spread the new ideas that led to the Reformation.\n\nFig. 9 – J.V. Schley, L’Imprimerie, 1739.   \n![](images/a4541026da4589751dfac44aa97cdd7271561f4fb8fc1efcf04559a7278e58e9.jpg)  \nThis is one of the many images produced in early modern Europe, celebrating the coming of print. You can see the printing press descending from heaven, carried by a goddess. On two sides of the goddess, blessing the machine, are Minerva (the goddess of wisdom) and Mercury (the messenger god, also symbolising reason). The women in the foreground are holding plaques with the portraits of six pioneer printers of different countries. In the middle ground on the left (figure encircled) is the portrait of Gutenberg.",

Several traditions of anti-Catholic Christianity developed out of the movement\n\n### 3.3 Print and Dissent\n\nPrint and popular religious literature stimulated many distinctive individual interpretations of faith even among little-educated working people. In the sixteenth century, Menocchio, a miller in Italy, began to read books that were available in his locality. He reinterpreted the message of the Bible and formulated a view of God and Creation that enraged the Roman Catholic Church. When the Roman Church began its inquisition to repress heretical ideas, Menocchio was hauled up twice and ultimately executed. The Roman Church, troubled by such effects of popular readings and questionings of faith, imposed severe controls over publishers and booksellers and began to maintain an Index of Prohibited Books from 1558 .\n\nFig. 10 – The macabre dance.   \n![](images/1645f29290583ef7d908337297c73e5be2ef3d18c198861d8cdcd043b56f9927.jpg)  \nThis sixteenth-century print shows how the fear of printing was dramatised in visual representations of the time.

    "text": "Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries literacy rates went up in most parts of Europe. Churches of different denominations set up schools in villages, carrying literacy to peasants and artisans. By the end of the eighteenth century, in some parts of Europe literacy rates were as high as 60 to 80 per cent. As literacy and schools spread in European countries, there was a virtual reading mania. People wanted books to read and printers produced books in everincreasing numbers.\n\nNew forms of popular literature appeared in print, targeting new audiences. Booksellers employed pedlars who roamed around villages, carrying little books for sale. There were almanacs or ritual calendars, along with ballads and folktales. But other forms of reading matter, largely for entertainment, began to reach ordinary readers as well. In England, penny chapbooks were carried by petty pedlars known as chapmen, and sold for a penny, so that even the poor could buy them. In France, were the “Biliotheque Bleue”, which were low-priced small books printed on poor quality paper, and bound in cheap blue covers. Then there were the romances, printed on four to six pages, and the more substantial ‘histories’ which were stories about the past. Books were of various sizes, serving many different purposes and interests.\n\nThe periodical press developed from the early eighteenth century, combining information about current affairs with entertainment. Newspapers and journals carried information about wars and trade, as well as news of developments in other places.\n\nSimilarly, the ideas of scientists and philosophers now became more accessible to the common people. Ancient and medieval scientific texts were compiled and published, and maps and scientific diagrams were widely printed. When scientists like Isaac Newton began to publish their discoveries, they could influence a much wider circle of scientifically minded readers. The writings of thinkers such as Thomas Paine, Voltaire and Jean Jacques Rousseau were also widely printed and read. Thus their ideas about science, reason and rationality found their way into popular literature.",

Many believed that books could change the world, liberate society from despotism and tyranny, and herald a time when reason and intellect would rule. Louise-Sebastien Mercier, a novelist in eighteenth-century France, declared: ‘The printing press is the most powerful engine of progress and public opinion is the force that will sweep despotism away.’ In many of Mercier’s novels, the heroes are transformed by acts of reading. They devour books, are lost in the world books create, and become enlightened in the process. Convinced of the power of print in bringing enlightenment and destroying the basis of despotism, Mercier proclaimed: ‘Tremble, therefore, tyrants of the world! Tremble before the virtual writer!’",

    "text": "Many historians have argued that print culture created the conditions within which French Revolution occurred. Can we make such a connection?\n\nThree types of arguments have been usually put forward.\n\nFirst: print popularised the ideas of the Enlightenment thinkers. Collectively, their writings provided a critical commentary on tradition, superstition and despotism. They argued for the rule of reason rather than custom, and demanded that everything be judged through the application of reason and rationality. They attacked the sacred authority of the Church and the despotic power of the state, thus eroding the legitimacy of a social order based on tradition. The writings of Voltaire and Rousseau were read widely; and those who read these books saw the world through new eyes, eyes that were questioning, critical and rational.\n\nSecond: print created a new culture of dialogue and debate. All values, norms and institutions were re-evaluated and discussed by a public that had become aware of the power of reason, and recognised the need to question existing ideas and beliefs. Within this public culture, new ideas of social revolution came into being.\n\nThird: by the 1780s there was an outpouring of literature that mocked the royalty and criticised their morality.

An easy eloquence, effortless and animated, carried me from one page to the next without my noticing it. A clock struck off the hours in the silence of the shadows, and I heard nothing. My lamp began to run out of oil and produced only a pale light, but still I read on. I could not even take out time to raise the wick for fear of interrupting my pleasure.

    "text": "The nineteenth century saw vast leaps in mass literacy in Europe, bringing in large numbers of new readers among children, women and workers.\n\n### 5.1 Children, Women and Workers\n\nAs primary education became compulsory from the late nineteenth century, children became an important category of readers. Production of school textbooks became critical for the publishing industry. A children’s press, devoted to literature for children alone, was set up in France in 1857. This press published new works as well as old fairy tales and folk tales. The Grimm Brothers in Germany spent years compiling traditional folk tales gathered from peasants. What they collected was edited before the stories were published in a collection in 1812. Anything that was considered unsuitable for children or would appear vulgar to the elites, was not included in the published version. Rural folk tales thus acquired a new form. In this way, print recorded old tales but also changed them.\n\nWomen became important as readers as well as writers. Penny magazines (see Fig. 12) were especially meant for women, as were manuals teaching proper behaviour and housekeeping. When novels began to be written in the nineteenth century, women were seen as important readers. Some of the best-\n\nknown novelists were women: Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters, George Eliot. Their writings became important in defining a new type of woman: a person with will, strength of personality, determination and the power to think.\n\nLending libraries had been in existence from the seventeenth century onwards. In the nineteenth century, lending libraries in England became instruments for educating white-collar workers, artisans and lower-middle-class people. Sometimes, self-educated working class people wrote for themselves. After the working day was gradually shortened from the mid-nineteenth century, workers had some time for self-improvement and self-expression. They wrote political tracts and autobiographies in large numbers.\n\n![](images/e181ce2e06eb7f896a304ccb6a1397604d9c95d851cf0d21b8d1053cad053c4c.jpg)  \nFig. 12 – Frontispiece of Penny Magazine. Penny Magazine was published between 1832 and 1835 in England by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. It was aimed primarily at the working class.",

Autobiographies of poor people narrated their struggles to read against grim obstacles: the twentieth-century Russian revolutionary author Maxim Gorky’s My Childhood and My University provide glimpses of such struggles.\n\n### 5.2 Further Innovations\n\nBy the late eighteenth century, the press came to be made out of metal. Through the nineteenth century, there were a series of further innovations in printing technology. By the mid-nineteenth century, Richard M. Hoe of New York had perfected the power-driven cylindrical press. This was capable of printing 8,000 sheets per hour. This press was particularly useful for printing newspapers. In the late nineteenth century, the offset press was developed which could print up to six colours at a time. From the turn of the twentieth century, electrically operated presses accelerated printing operations. A series of other developments followed. Methods of feeding paper improved, the quality of plates became better, automatic paper reels and photoelectric controls of the colour register were introduced. The accumulation of several individual mechanical improvements transformed the appearance of printed texts.\n\nPrinters and publishers continuously developed new strategies to sell their product. Nineteenth-century periodicals serialised important novels, which gave birth to a particular way of writing novels. In the 1920s in England, popular works were sold in cheap series, called the Shilling Series. The dust cover or the book jacket is also a twentieth-century innovation. With the onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s, publishers feared a decline in book purchases. To sustain buying, they brought out cheap paperback editions.",

Manuscripts were copied on palm leaves or on handmade paper. Pages were sometimes beautifully illustrated. They would be either pressed between wooden covers or sewn together to ensure preservation. Manuscripts continued to be produced till well after the introduction of print, down to the late nineteenth century.\n\nManuscripts, however, were highly expensive and fragile. They had to be handled carefully, and they could not be read easily as the\n\n![](images/607ced218360935e765f9d8211656d3244bc5929adfe34d75789dbbcea737f72.jpg)  \nFig. 14 – Pages from the Gita Govinda of Jayadeva, eighteenth century.

Manuscripts like this continued to be produced for the rich even after the coming of the letterpress.\n\nscript was written in different styles. So manuscripts were not widely used in everyday life. Even though pre-colonial Bengal had developed an extensive network of village primary schools, students very often did not read texts. They only learnt to write. Teachers dictated portions of texts from memory and students wrote them down. Many thus became literate without ever actually reading any kinds of texts.\n\nFig. 16 – Pages from the Rigveda.   \n![](images/2f035ef560e4a2c5f947ba56d2f4575218033b9cb1fb5cf7fca45a3e53da8314.jpg)  \nHandwritten manuscripts continued to be produced in India till much after the coming of print.

By 1674, about 50 books had been printed in the Konkani and in Kanara languages. Catholic priests printed the first Tamil book in 1579 at Cochin, and in 1713 the first Malayalam book was printed by them. By 1710, Dutch Protestant missionaries had printed 32 Tamil texts, many of them translations of older works.\n\nThe English language press did not grow in India till quite late even though the English East India Company began to import presses from the late seventeenth century.\n\nFrom 1780, James Augustus Hickey began to edit the Bengal Gazette , a weekly magazine that described itself as ‘a commercial paper open to all, but influenced by none’. So it was private English enterprise, proud of its independence from colonial influence, that began English printing in India. Hickey published a lot of advertisements, including those that related to the import and sale of slaves. But he also published a lot of gossip about the Company’s senior officials in India. Enraged by this, Governor-General Warren Hastings persecuted Hickey, and encouraged the publication of officially sanctioned newspapers that could counter the flow of information that damaged the image of the colonial government. By the close of the eighteenth century, a number of newspapers and journals appeared in print. There were Indians, too, who began to publish Indian newspapers. The first to appear was the weekly Bengal Gazette, brought out by Gangadhar Bhattacharya, who was close to Rammohun Roy.",

    "text": "From the early nineteenth century, as you know, there were intense debates around religious issues. Different groups confronted the changes happening within colonial society in different ways, and offered a variety of new interpretations of the beliefs of different religions. Some criticised existing practices and campaigned for reform, while others countered the arguments of reformers. These debates were carried out in public and in print. Printed tracts and newspapers not only spread the new ideas, but they shaped the nature of the debate. A wider public could now participate in these public discussions and express their views. New ideas emerged through these clashes of opinions.\n\nThis was a time of intense controversies between social and religious reformers and the Hindu orthodoxy over matters like widow immolation, monotheism, Brahmanical priesthood and idolatry. In Bengal, as the debate developed, tracts and newspapers proliferated, circulating a variety of arguments. To reach a wider audience, the ideas were printed in the everyday, spoken language of ordinary people. Rammohun Roy published the Sambad Kaumudi from 1821 and the Hindu orthodoxy commissioned the Samachar Chandrika to oppose his opinions. From 1822, two Persian newspapers were published, Jam-i-Jahan Nama and Shamsul Akhbar. In the same year, a Gujarati newspaper, the Bombay Samachar, made its appearance.\n\nIn north India, the ulama were deeply anxious about the collapse of Muslim dynasties. They feared that colonial rulers would encourage conversion, change the Muslim personal laws. To counter this, they used cheap lithographic presses, published Persian and Urdu translations of holy scriptures, and printed religious newspapers and tracts. The Deoband Seminary, founded in 1867, published thousands upon thousands of fatwas telling Muslim readers how to conduct themselves in their everyday lives, and explaining the meanings of Islamic doctrines. All through the nineteenth century, a number of Muslim sects and seminaries appeared, each with a different interpretation of faith, each keen on enlarging its following and countering the influence of its opponents. Urdu print helped them conduct these battles in public.\n\nAmong Hindus, too, print encouraged the reading of religious texts, especially in the vernacular languages. The first printed edition of",

    "text": "Printing created an appetite for new kinds of writing. As more and more people could now read, they wanted to see their own lives, experiences, emotions and relationships reflected in what they read. The novel, a literary firm which had developed in Europe, ideally catered to this need. It soon acquired distinctively Indian forms and styles. For readers, it opened up new worlds of experience, and gave a vivid sense of the diversity of human lives.\n\nOther new literary forms also entered the world of reading – lyrics, short stories, essays about social and political matters. In different ways, they reinforced the new emphasis on human lives and intimate feelings, about the political and social rules that shaped such things.\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, a new visual culture was taking shape. With the setting up of an increasing number of printing presses, visual images could be easily reproduced in multiple copies. Painters like Raja Ravi Varma produced images for mass circulation. Poor wood engravers who made woodblocks set up shop near the letterpresses, and were employed by print shops. Cheap prints and calendars, easily available in the bazaar, could be bought even by the poor to decorate the walls of their homes or places of work. These prints began shaping popular ideas about modernity and tradition, religion and politics, and society and culture.\n\nBy the 1870s, caricatures and cartoons were being published in journals and newspapers, commenting on social and political issues. Some caricatures ridiculed the educated Indians’ fascination with Western tastes and clothes, while others expressed the fear of social change. There were imperial caricatures lampooning nationalists, as well as nationalist cartoons criticising imperial rule.\n\n![](images/1f43a59ee13b7e235e81615d5c88bb03f94dd9c9d29f1bc56759cb390ffc1c6f.jpg)  \nFig. 17 – Raja Ritudhwaj rescuing Princess Madalsa from the captivity of demons, print by Ravi Varma.

    "text": "Lives and feelings of women began to be written in particularly vivid and intense ways. Women’s reading, therefore, increased enormously in middle-class homes. Liberal husbands and fathers began educating their womenfolk at home, and sent them to schools when women’s schools were set up in the cities and towns after the mid-nineteenth century. Many journals began carrying writings by women, and explained why women should be educated. They also carried a syllabus and attached suitable reading matter which could be used for home-based schooling.\n\nBut not all families were liberal. Conservative Hindus believed that a literate girl would be widowed and Muslims feared that educated women would be corrupted by reading Urdu romances. Sometimes, rebel women defied such prohibition. We know the story of a girl in a conservative Muslim family of north India who secretly learnt to read and write in Urdu. Her family wanted her to read only the Arabic Quran which she did not understand. So she insisted on learning to read a language that was her own. In East Bengal, in the early nineteenth century, Rashsundari Debi, a young married girl in a very orthodox household, learnt to read in the secrecy of her kitchen. Later, she wrote her autobiography Amar Jiban which was published in 1876. It was the first full-length autobiography published in the Bengali language.\n\nSince social reforms and novels had already created a great interest in women’s lives and emotions, there was also an interest in what women would have to say about their own lives. From the 1860s, a few Bengali women like Kailashbashini Debi wrote books highlighting the experiences of women – about how women were imprisoned at home, kept in ignorance, forced to do hard domestic labour and treated unjustly by the very people they served. In the 1880s, in present-day Maharashtra, Tarabai Shinde and Pandita Ramabai wrote with passionate anger about the miserable lives of upper-caste Hindu women, especially widows. A woman in a Tamil novel expressed what reading meant to women who were so greatly confined by social regulations: ‘For various reasons, my world is small … More than half my life’s happiness has come from books …’\n\nWhile Urdu, Tamil, Bengali and Marathi print culture had developed early, Hindi printing began seriously only from the 1870s. Soon, a large segment of it was devoted to the education of women.

    "text": "In 1926, Begum Rokeya Sakhawat Hossein, a noted educationist and literary figure, strongly condemned men for withholding education from women in the name of religion as she addressed the Bengal Women’s Education Conference:\n\n‘The opponents of female education say that women will become unruly … Fie! They call themselves Muslims and yet go against the basic tenet of Islam which gives Women an equal right to education. If men are not led astray once educated, why should women?’\n\nthe early twentieth century, journals, written for and sometimes edited by women, became extremely popular. They discussed issues like women’s education, widowhood, widow remarriage and the national movement. Some of them offered household and fashion lessons to women and brought entertainment through short stories and serialised novels.\n\nIn Punjab, too, a similar folk literature was widely printed from the early twentieth century. Ram Chaddha published the fast-selling Istri Dharm Vichar to teach women how to be obedient wives. The Khalsa Tract Society published cheap booklets with a similar message. Many of these were in the form of dialogues about the qualities of a good woman.\n\nIn Bengal, an entire area in central Calcutta – the Battala – was devoted to the printing of popular books. Here you could buy cheap editions of religious tracts and scriptures, as well as literature that was considered obscene and scandalous. By the late nineteenth century, a lot of these books were being profusely illustrated with woodcuts and coloured lithographs. Pedlars took the Battala publications to homes, enabling women to read them in their leisure time.\n\n![](images/98c35a63c4c386a4badd1c20ef2c5d6d77a07b4109f8d1e84576908e90d334f4.jpg)  \nFig. 19 – Ghor Kali (The End of the World), coloured woodcut, late nineteenth century.\n\nThe artist’s vision of the destruction of proper family relations.

    "text": "Very cheap small books were brought to markets in nineteenth-century Madras towns and sold at crossroads, allowing poor people travelling to markets to buy them. Public libraries were set up from the early twentieth century, expanding the access to books. These libraries were located mostly in cities and towns, and at times in prosperous villages. For rich local patrons, setting up a library was a way of acquiring prestige.\n\nFrom the late nineteenth century, issues of caste discrimination began to be written about in many printed tracts and essays. Jyotiba Phule, the Maratha pioneer of ‘low caste’ protest movements, wrote about the injustices of the caste system in his Gulamgiri (1871). In the twentieth century, B.R. Ambedkar in Maharashtra and E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker in Madras, better known as Periyar, wrote powerfully on caste and their writings were read by people all over India. Local protest movements and sects also created a lot of popular journals and tracts criticising ancient scriptures and envisioning a new and just future.\n\nWorkers in factories were too overworked and lacked the education to write much about their experiences. But Kashibaba, a Kanpur millworker, wrote and published Chhote Aur Bade Ka Sawal in 1938 to show the links between caste and class exploitation. The poems of another Kanpur millworker, who wrote under the name of Sudarshan Chakr between 1935 and 1955, were brought together and published in a collection called Sacchi Kavitayan. By the 1930s, Bangalore cotton millworkers set up libraries to educate themselves, following the example of Bombay workers. These were sponsored by social reformers who tried to restrict excessive drinking among them, to bring literacy and, sometimes, to propagate the message of nationalism.",

    "text": "Before 1798, the colonial state under the East India Company was not too concerned with censorship. Strangely, its early measures to control printed matter were directed against Englishmen in India who were critical of Company misrule and hated the actions of particular Company officers. The Company was worried that such criticisms might be used by its critics in England to attack its trade monopoly in India.\n\nBy the 1820s, the Calcutta Supreme Court passed certain regulations to control press freedom and the Company began encouraging publication of newspapers that would celebrate Britsh rule. In 1835, faced with urgent petitions by editors of English and vernacular newspapers, Governor-General Bentinck agreed to revise press laws. Thomas Macaulay, a liberal colonial official, formulated new rules that restored the earlier freedoms.\n\nAfter the revolt of 1857, the attitude to freedom of the press changed. Enraged Englishmen demanded a clamp down on the ‘native’ press. As vernacular newspapers became assertively nationalist, the colonial government began debating measures of stringent control. In 1878, the Vernacular Press Act was passed, modelled on the Irish Press Laws. It provided the government with extensive rights to censor reports and editorials in the vernacular press. From now on the government kept regular track of the vernacular newspapers published in different provinces. When a report was judged as seditious, the newspaper was warned, and if the warning was ignored, the press was liable to be seized and the printing machinery confiscated.\n\nDespite repressive measures, nationalist newspapers grew in numbers in all parts of India. They reported on colonial misrule and encouraged nationalist activities. Attempts to throttle nationalist criticism provoked militant protest. This in turn led to a renewed cycle of persecution and protests. When Punjab revolutionaries were deported in 1907, Balgangadhar Tilak wrote with great sympathy about them in his Kesari. This led to his imprisonment in 1908, provoking in turn widespread protests all over India.",

The colonial government kept continuous track of all books and newspapers published in India and passed numerous laws to control the press.\n\nDuring the First World War, under the Defence of India Rules, 22 newspapers had to furnish securities. Of these, 18 shut down rather than comply with government orders. The Sedition Committee Report under Rowlatt in 1919 further strengthened controls that led to imposition of penalties on various newspapers. At the outbreak of the Second World War, the Defence of India Act was passed, allowing censoring of reports of war-related topics. All reports about the Quit India movement came under its purview.

    "text": "### 1.1 Introduction\n\nIn Class IX, you began your exploration of the world of real numbers and encountered irrational numbers. We continue our discussion on real numbers in this chapter. We begin with two very important properties of positive integers in Sections 1.2 and 1.3, namely the Euclid’s division algorithm and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\n\nEuclid’s division algorithm, as the name suggests, has to do with divisibility of integers. Stated simply, it says any positive integer a can be divided by another positive integer $b$ in such a way that it leaves a remainder r that is smaller than $b$ . Many of you probably recognise this as the usual long division process. Although this result is quite easy to state and understand, it has many applications related to the divisibility properties of integers. We touch upon a few of them, and use it mainly to compute the HCF of two positive integers.\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, on the other hand, has to do something with multiplication of positive integers. You already know that every composite number can be expressed as a product of primes in a unique way — this important fact is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Again, while it is a result that is easy to state and understand, it has some very deep and significant applications in the field of mathematics. We use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic for two main applications. First, we use it to prove the irrationality of many of the numbers you studied in Class IX, such as ${ \\sqrt { 2 } } , { \\sqrt { 3 } }$ and $\\sqrt { 5 }$ . Second, we apply this theorem to explore when exactly the decimal expansion of a rational number, say ${ \\frac { p } { q } } ( q \\neq 0 )$ , is terminating and when it is non-terminating repeating. We do so by looking at the prime factorisation of the denominator $q$ of $\\frac { p } { q }$ . You will see that the prime factorisation of $q$ will completely reveal the nature of the decimal expansion of $\\frac { p } { a }$ . q\n\nSo let us begin our exploration.",

    "text": "In your earlier classes, you have seen that any natural number can be written as a product of its prime factors. For instance, $2 = 2$ , $4 = 2 \\times 2$ , $2 5 3 = 1 1 \\times 2 3$ , and so on. Now, let us try and look at natural numbers from the other direction. That is, can any natural number be obtained by multiplying prime numbers? Let us see.\n\nTake any collection of prime numbers, say 2, 3, 7, 11 and 23. If we multiply some or all of these numbers, allowing them to repeat as many times as we wish, we can produce a large collection of positive integers (In fact, infinitely many). Let us list a few :\n\n$$\n7 \\times 1 1 \\times 2 3 = 1 7 7 1 \\quad 3 \\times 7 \\times 1 1 \\times 2 3 = 5 3 1 3\n$$\n\n$$\n2 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 1 1 \\times 2 3 = 1 0 6 2 6 2 ^ {3} \\times 3 \\times 7 ^ {3} = 8 2 3 2\n$$\n\n$$\n2 ^ {2} \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 1 1 \\times 2 3 = 2 1 2 5 2\n$$\n\nand so on.\n\nNow, let us suppose your collection of primes includes all the possible primes. What is your guess about the size of this collection? Does it contain only a finite number of integers,\n\nor infinitely many? Infact, there are infinitely many primes. So, if we combine all these primes in all possible ways, we will get an infinite collection of numbers, all the primes and all possible products of primes. The question is – can we produce all the composite numbers this way? What do you think? Do you think that there may be a composite number which is not the product of powers of primes? Before we answer this, let us factorise positive integers, that is, do the opposite of what we have done so far.\n\nWe are going to use the factor tree with which you are all familiar. Let us take some large number, say, 32760, and factorise it as shown.\n\n![](images/77bb9cb9fefeecfeb22c8035a9834bb5123de29862cad66d63b84c3fedd2ef93.jpg)",

Let us try another number, say, 123 456789. This can be written as $3 ^ { 2 } \\times 3 8 0 3 \\times 3 6 0 7$ . Of course, you have to check that 3803 and 3607 are primes! (Try it out for several other natural numbers yourself.) This leads us to a conjecture that every composite number can be written as the product of powers of primes. In fact, this statement is true, and is called the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic because of its basic crucial importance to the study of integers. Let us now formally state this theorem.\n\nTheorem 1.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) : Every composite number can be expressed (factorised) as a product of primes, and this factorisation is unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur.\n\nAn equivalent version of Theorem 1.2 was probably first recorded as Proposition 14 of Book IX in Euclid’s Elements, before it came to be known as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. However, the first correct proof was given by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae.\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss is often referred to as the ‘Prince of Mathematicians’ and is considered one of the three greatest mathematicians of all time, along with Archimedes and Newton. He has made fundamental contributions to both mathematics and science.\n\n![](images/6b969ad52c0da15c624b65d10e4992b90e214f001e2a10419f9253253aa03516.jpg)  \nCarl Friedrich Gauss (1777 – 1855)\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says that every composite number can be factorised as a product of primes. Actually it says more. It says that given any composite number it can be factorised as a product of prime numbers in a ‘unique’ way, except for the order in which the primes occur. That is, given any composite number there is one and only one way to write it as a product of primes, as long as we are not particular about the order in which the primes occur. So, for example, we regard $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7$ as the same as $3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 2$ , or any other possible order in which these primes are written. This fact is also stated in the following form:\n\nThe prime factorisation of a natural number is unique, except for the order of its factors.",

Let us look at some examples.\n\nExample 1 : Consider the numbers $4 ^ { n }$ , where $n$ is a natural number. Check whether there is any value of $n$ for which $4 ^ { n }$ ends with the digit zero.\n\nSolution : If the number $4 ^ { n }$ , for any $n$ , were to end with the digit zero, then it would be divisible by 5. That is, the prime factorisation of $4 ^ { n }$ would contain the prime 5. This is not possible because $4 ^ { n } = ( 2 ) ^ { 2 n }$ ; so the only prime in the factorisation of $4 ^ { n }$ is 2. So, the uniqueness of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic guarantees that there are no other primes in the factorisation of $4 ^ { n }$ . So, there is no natural number $n$ for which $4 ^ { n }$ ends with the digit zero.\n\nYou have already learnt how to find the HCF and LCM of two positive integers using the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic in earlier classes, without realising it! This method is also called the prime factorisation method. Let us recall this method through an example.\n\nExample 2 : Find the LCM and HCF of 6 and 20 by the prime factorisation method.\n\nSolution : We have : $6 = 2 ^ { 1 } \\times 3 ^ { 1 }$ and $2 0 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 5 = 2 ^ { 2 } \\times 5 ^ { 1 } .$ .\n\nYou can find $\\mathrm { H C F } ( 6 , 2 0 ) = 2$ and $\\mathrm { L C M } ( 6 , 2 0 ) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 6 0 .$ , as done in your earlier classes.",

    "text": "In Class IX, you were introduced to irrational numbers and many of their properties. You studied about their existence and how the rationals and the irrationals together made up the real numbers. You even studied how to locate irrationals on the number line. However, we did not prove that they were irrationals. In this section, we will prove that ${ \\sqrt { 2 } } , { \\sqrt { 3 } } , { \\sqrt { 5 } }$ and, in general, $\\sqrt { p }$ is irrational, where $p$ is a prime. One of the theorems, we use in our proof, is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\n\nRecall, a number $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { \\mathsf { c } } } _ { S } ,$ is called irrational if it cannot be written in the form $\\frac { p } { q }$ , where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \\neq 0$ . Some examples of irrational numbers, with which you are already familiar, are :\n\n$$\n\\sqrt {2}, \\sqrt {3}, \\sqrt {1 5}, \\pi , - \\frac {\\sqrt {2}}{\\sqrt {3}}, 0. 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 \\dots , \\text {e t c .}\n$$\n\nBefore we prove that $\\sqrt { 2 }$ is irrational, we need the following theorem, whose proof is based on the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\n\nTheorem 1.2 : Let p be a prime number. If p divides $a ^ { 2 }$ , then p divides a, where a is a positive integer.\n\n*Proof : Let the prime factorisation of $a$ be as follows :\n\n$a = p _ { 1 } p _ { 2 } \\ldots p _ { n } ;$ where $p _ { 1 } , p _ { 2 } , . . . , p _ { n }$ are primes, not necessarily distinct.\n\nTherefore, $a ^ { 2 } = ( p _ { 1 } p _ { 2 } \\ldots p _ { n } ) ( p _ { 1 } p _ { 2 } \\ldots p _ { n } ) = p _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } p _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } \\ldots p _ { n } ^ { 2 } .$\n\nNow, we are given that $p$ divides $a ^ { 2 }$ . Therefore, from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, it follows that $p$ is one of the prime factors of $a ^ { 2 }$ . However, using the uniqueness part of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, we realise that the only prime factors of $a ^ { 2 }$ are $p _ { 1 } , p _ { 2 } , . . . ,$ $p _ { n }$ . So $p$ is one of $p _ { 1 } , p _ { 2 } , . . . , p _ { n }$ .",

Recall that if $p ( x )$ is a polynomial in $x .$ , the highest power of $x$ in $p ( x )$ is called the degree of the polynomial $p ( x )$ . For example, $4 x + 2$ is a polynomial in the variable $x$ of degree 1, $2 y ^ { 2 } - 3 y + 4$ is a polynomial in the variable y of degree 2, $5 x ^ { 3 } - 4 x ^ { 2 } + x - \\sqrt { 2 }$ is a polynomial in the variable $x$ of degree 3 and $7 u ^ { 6 } - \\frac { 3 } { 2 } u ^ { 4 } + 4 u ^ { 2 } + u - 8$ 二 is a polynomial in the variable $u$ of degree 6. Expressions like $\\frac { 1 } { x - 1 }$ ${ \\frac { 1 } { x - 1 } } , { \\sqrt { x } } + 2 , { \\frac { 1 } { x ^ { 2 } + 2 x + 3 } }$ etc., are not polynomials. x - 1\n\nA polynomial of degree 1 is called a linear polynomial. For example, 2x – 3, ${ \\sqrt { 3 } } x + 5$ , $y + \\sqrt { 2 } , x - \\frac { 2 } { 1 1 } , 3 z + 4 , \\frac { 2 } { 3 } u + 1$ , etc., are all linear polynomials. Polynomials such as $2 x + 5 - x ^ { 2 } .$ , $x ^ { 3 } + 1$ , etc., are not linear polynomials.\n\nA polynomial of degree 2 is called a quadratic polynomial. The name ‘quadratic’ has been derived from the word ‘quadrate’, which means ‘square’. $2 x ^ { 2 } + 3 x - \\frac { 2 } { 5 } , y ^ { 2 } - 2 , 2 - x ^ { 2 } + \\sqrt { 3 } x ,$ $\\frac { u } { 3 } - 2 u ^ { 2 } + 5 , \\sqrt { 5 } \\nu ^ { 2 } - \\frac { 2 } { 3 } \\nu , 4 z ^ { 2 } + \\frac { 1 } { 7 }$ 2 2 , 4 + v z are some examples of quadratic polynomials (whose coefficients are real numbers). More generally, any quadratic polynomial in $x$ is of the form $a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c .$ , where $a , b , c$ are real numbers and $a \\neq 0 .$ . A polynomial of degree 3 is called a cubic polynomial.",

    "text": "You know that a real number $k$ is a zero of the polynomial $p ( x )$ if $p ( k ) = 0$ . But why are the zeroes of a polynomial so important? To answer this, first we will see the geometrical representations of linear and quadratic polynomials and the geometrical meaning of their zeroes.\n\nConsider first a linear polynomial $a x + b$ , $a \\neq 0$ . You have studied in Class IX that the graph of $y = a x + b$ is a straight line. For example, the graph of $y = 2 x + 3$ is a straight line passing through the points $( - 2 , - 1 )$ and (2, 7).\n\n<table><tr><td>x</td><td>-2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>y=2x+3</td><td>-1</td><td>7</td></tr></table>\n\nFrom Fig. 2.1, you can see that the graph of $y = 2 x + 3$ intersects the $x$ -axis mid-way between $x = - 1$ and $x = - 2$ , that is, at the point 3 , 0æ ö-ç ÷ . $\\left( - { \\frac { 3 } { 2 } } , 0 \\right)$ You also know that the zero of $2 x + 3$ is $- { \\frac { 3 } { 2 } }$ . Thus, the zero of the polynomial $2 x \\quad + \\quad 3$ i s th e $x$ -coordinate of the point where the graph of $y = 2 x + 3$ intersects the $x \\cdot$ - axis.\n\n![](images/8402bf78345c4aee0adc2146fae66153a29911b844860f05ee746fd9d87af557.jpg)  \nFig. 2.1\n\nIn general, for a linear polynomial $a x + b$ , $a \\neq 0$ , the graph of $y = a x + b$ is a straight line which intersects the $x$ -axis at exactly one point, namely, $\\left( { \\frac { - b } { a } } , 0 \\right)$ . Therefore, the linear polynomial $a x + b$ , $a \\neq 0$ , has exactly one zero, namely, the $x \\cdot$ -coordinate of the point where the graph of $y = a x + b$ intersects the $x$ -axis.\n\nNow, let us look for the geometrical meaning of a zero of a quadratic polynomial. Consider the quadratic polynomial $x ^ { 2 } - 3 x - 4 .$ Let us see what the graph* of $y = x ^ { 2 } - 3 x - 4$ looks like. Let us list a few values of $y = x ^ { 2 } - 3 x - 4$ corresponding to a few values for $x$ as given in Table 2.1.\n\nTable 2.1   \n\n<table><tr><td>x</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>y=x2-3x-4</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>-4</td><td>-6</td><td>-6</td><td>-4</td><td>0</td><td>6</td></tr></table>\n\nIf we locate the points listed above on a graph paper and draw the graph, it will actually look like the one given in Fig. 2.2.",

    "text": "In fact, for any quadratic polynomial $a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c$ , $a \\neq 0$ , the graph of the corresponding equation $y = a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c$ has one of the two shapes either open upwards like $\\cup$ or open downwards like $\\cap$ depending on whether $a > 0$ or $a < 0$ . (These curves are called parabolas.)\n\nYou can see from Table 2.1 that –1 and 4 are zeroes of the quadratic polynomial. Also note from Fig. 2.2 that $^ { - 1 }$ and 4 are the $x$ -coordinates of the points where the graph of $y = x ^ { 2 } - 3 x - 4$ intersects the $x$ -axis. Thus, the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial $x ^ { 2 } - 3 x - 4$ are $x$ -coordinates of the points where the graph of $y = x ^ { 2 } - 3 x - 4$ intersects the $x$ -axis.\n\n![](images/61545c35de5f2d2dff3cd301771606723b5645a991c510b2680a6f70e5b2d519.jpg)  \nFig. 2.2\n\nThis fact is true for any quadratic polynomial, i.e., the zeroes of a quadratic polynomial $a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c , a \\neq 0$ , are precisely the $x$ -coordinates of the points where the parabola representing $y = a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c$ intersects the $x$ -axis.\n\nFrom our observation earlier about the shape of the graph of $y = a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c$ , the following three cases can happen:\n\nCase (i) : Here, the graph cuts $x \\cdot$ -axis at two distinct points A and A¢.\n\nThe $x$ -coordinates of A and $\\mathbf { A ^ { \\prime } }$ are the two zeroes of the quadratic polynomial $a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c$ in this case (see Fig. 2.3).\n\n![](images/7f464c17bf9df13f0cec8928d00998ca4e515d7a86e3db31583c94c859e543cf.jpg)\n\n![](images/2ce96ccde5fc030d114a1024039e6d007bdb7998e1f365acc3e9f88bd014f45d.jpg)  \nFig. 2.3\n\nCase (ii) : Here, the graph cuts the $x$ -axis at exactly one point, i.e., at two coincident points. So, the two points A and A¢ of Case (i) coincide here to become one point A (see Fig. 2.4).\n\n![](images/17f27838c93cd4bb8e3cff549cec3f5bb463660981c878c3fd29ae0d7740d490.jpg)\n\n![](images/4ee52255ba164a3d60836c4e33b8fc94e9f06fc3bd4e4eab6465fc66b406ad45.jpg)  \nFig. 2.4\n\nThe $x$ -coordinate of A is the only zero for the quadratic polynomial $a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c$ in this case.\n\nCase (iii) : Here, the graph is either completely above the $x$ -axis or completely below the $x$ - axis. So, it does not cut the $x$ -axis at any point (see Fig. 2.5).\n\n![](images/03b0863a4595aade2a465c0600c2ccbbe51d2e4013fef2d39a0a6bd8e2a0df58.jpg)  \ni\n\n![](images/c464c42bb68f3688c9099ef288e9b6ceb1ae89435acf44c541a237f8be1257a8.jpg)  \n(ii)   \nFig. 2.5\n\nSo, the quadratic polynomial $a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c$ has no zero in this case.\n\nSo, you can see geometrically that a quadratic polynomial can have either two distinct zeroes or two equal zeroes (i.e., one zero), or no zero.

    "text": "Now, what do you expect the geometrical meaning of the zeroes of a cubic polynomial to be? Let us find out. Consider the cubic polynomial $x ^ { 3 } - 4 x$ . To see what the graph o $\\mathrm { f } y = x ^ { 3 } - 4 x$ looks like, let us list a few values of y corresponding to a few values for $x$ as shown in Table 2.2.\n\nTable 2.2   \n\n<table><tr><td>x</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>y=x3-4x</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>-3</td><td>0</td></tr></table>\n\nLocating the points of the table on a graph paper and drawing the graph, we see that the graph of $y = x ^ { 3 } - 4 x$ actually looks like the one given in Fig. 2.6.\n\nWe see from the table above that – 2, 0 and 2 are zeroes of the cubic polynomial $x ^ { 3 } - 4 x$ . Observe that – 2, 0 and 2 are, in fact, the $x$ -coordinates of the only points where the graph of $y = x ^ { 3 } - 4 x$ intersects the $x$ -axis. Since the curve meets the $x$ - axis in only these 3 points, their $x$ -coordinates are the only zeroes of the polynomial.\n\nLet us take a few more examples. Consider the cubic polynomials $x ^ { 3 }$ and $x ^ { 3 } - x ^ { 2 }$ . We draw the graphs of $y = x ^ { 3 }$ and $y = x ^ { 3 } - x ^ { 2 }$ in Fig. 2. 7 and Fig. 2. 8 respectively.\n\n![](images/09d4890ee2a52634f7f530fd51fa5c03ef7065017d8361beb41ea79f08f7aa33.jpg)  \nFig. 2.6\n\n![](images/72d7cc13830ea257a36c38ac2b9246a04581eddcedf307ee5d9adbdb07a7eeca.jpg)  \nFig. 2.7\n\n![](images/f74c191bea71b2f9b88d37e572f58d6a70333741354e19d030c7431306b45542.jpg)  \nFig. 2.8\n\nNote that 0 is the only zero of the polynomial $x ^ { 3 }$ . Also, from Fig. 2.7, you can see that 0 is the x - coordinate of the only point where the graph of $y \\ = \\ x ^ { 3 }$ intersects the $x$ -axis. Similarly, since $x ^ { 3 } - x ^ { 2 } = x ^ { 2 } ( x - 1 )$ , 0 and 1 are the only zeroes of the polynomial $x ^ { 3 } - x ^ { 2 }$ . Also, from Fig. 2.8, these values are the $x$ -coordinates of the only points where the graph of $y = x ^ { 3 } - x ^ { 2 }$ intersects the $x$ -axis.\n\nFrom the examples above, we see that there are at most 3 zeroes for any cubic polynomial. In other words, any polynomial of degree 3 can have at most three zeroes.\n\nRemark : In general, given a polynomial $p ( x )$ of degree $n$ , the graph of $y = p ( x )$ intersects the $x$ -axis at atmost $n$ points. Therefore, a polynomial $p ( x )$ of degree $n$ has at most n zeroes.",

We will now try to answer the question raised in Section 2.1 regarding the relationship between zeroes and coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial, $\\operatorname { s a y } p ( x ) = 2 x ^ { 2 } - 8 x + 6$ . In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term $\\smile 8 x \\ '$ as a sum of two terms, whose product is $6 \\times 2 x ^ { 2 } = 1 2 x ^ { 2 }$ . So, we write\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l} 2 x ^ {2} - 8 x + 6 = 2 x ^ {2} - 6 x - 2 x + 6 = 2 x (x - 3) - 2 (x - 3) \\\\ = (2 x - 2) (x - 3) = 2 (x - 1) (x - 3) \\\\ \\end{array}\n$$\n\nSo, the value of $p ( x ) = 2 x ^ { 2 } - 8 x + 6$ is zero when $x - 1 = 0$ or $x - 3 = 0$ , i.e., when $x = 1$ or $x = 3$ . So, the zeroes of $2 x ^ { 2 } - 8 x + 6$ are 1 and 3. Observe that :\n\n$$\n\\text {S u m o f i t s z e r o e s} = 1 + 3 = 4 = \\frac {- (- 8)}{2} = \\frac {- (\\text {C o e f f i c i e n t o f} x)}{\\text {C o e f f i c i e n t o f} x ^ {2}}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text {P r o d u c t} = 1 \\times 3 = 3 = \\frac {6}{2} = \\frac {\\text {C o n s t a n t t e r m}}{\\text {C o e f f i c i e n t o f} x ^ {2}}\n$$\n\nLet us take one more quadratic polynomial, say, $p ( x ) = 3 x ^ { 2 } + 5 x - 2$ . By the method of splitting the middle term,",

She wanted to enjoy rides on the Giant Wheel and play Hoopla (a game in which you throw a ring on the items kept in a stall, and if the ring covers any object completely, you get it). The number of times she played Hoopla is half the number of rides she had on the Giant Wheel. If each ride costs $\\yen 3$ , and a game of Hoopla costs $\\yen 4$ , how would you find out the number of rides she had and how many times she played Hoopla, provided she spent $\\yen 20$ .\n\nMay be you will try it by considering different cases. If she has one ride, is it possible? Is it possible to have two rides? And so on. Or you may use the knowledge of Class IX, to represent such situations as linear equations in two variables.\n\n![](images/a14859a86cc1bf84d14eabb899a118bdb7e8c1237e87e972d4083b14d9e8e9f7.jpg)\n\nLet us try this approach.\n\nDenote the number of rides that Akhila had by $x _ { \\mathrm { { ; } } }$ , and the number of times she played Hoopla by y. Now the situation can be represented by the two equations:\n\n$$\ny = \\frac {1}{2} x \\tag {1}\n$$\n\n$$\n3 x + 4 y = 2 0 \\tag {2}\n$$\n\nCan we find the solutions of this pair of equations?

    "text": "A pair of linear equations which has no solution, is called an inconsistent pair of linear equations. A pair of linear equations in two variables, which has a solution, is called a consistent pair of linear equations. A pair of linear equations which are equivalent has infinitely many distinct common solutions. Such a pair is called a dependent pair of linear equations in two variables. Note that a dependent pair of linear equations is always consistent.\n\nWe can now summarise the behaviour of lines representing a pair of linear equations in two variables and the existence of solutions as follows:\n\n(i) the lines may intersect in a single point.

You can verify them by considering some more examples by yourself.\n\nLet us now consider some more examples to illustrate it.\n\nExample 1 : Check graphically whether the pair of equations\n\nand\n\n$$\nx + 3 y = 6 \\tag {1}\n$$\n\n$$\n2 x - 3 y = 1 2 \\tag {2}\n$$\n\nis consistent. If so, solve them graphically.\n\nSolution : Let us draw the graphs of the Equations (1) and (2). For this, we find two solutions of each of the equations, which are given in Table 3.2\n\nTable 3.2   \n\n<table><tr><td>x</td><td>0</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>y = 6-x/3</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr></table>\n\nPlot the points A(0, 2), B(6, 0), $\\mathrm { P } ( 0 , -$ 4) and $Q ( 3 , - 2 )$ on graph paper, and join the points to form the lines AB and PQ as shown in Fig. 3.1.\n\nWe observe that there is a point B (6, 0) common to both the lines AB and PQ. So, the solution of the pair of linear equations is $x = 6$ and $y = 0$ , i.e., the given pair of equations is consistent.\n\n<table><tr><td>x</td><td>0</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>y = 2x - 12 / 3</td><td>-4</td><td>-2</td></tr></table>\n\n![](images/a10cab8073043cfef8d4ee99ca092c68f91b9f66b6609d9be998665f54e61c24.jpg)  \nFig. 3.1\n\nExample 2 : Graphically, find whether the following pair of equations has no solution, unique solution or infinitely many solutions:\n\n$$\n5 x - 8 y + 1 = 0 \\tag {1}\n$$\n\n$$\n3 x - \\frac {2 4}{5} y + \\frac {3}{5} = 0 \\tag {2}\n$$\n\nSolution : Multiplying Equation (2) by , we get ${ \\frac { 5 } { 3 } } ,$\n\n$$\n5 x - 8 y + 1 = 0\n$$\n\nBut, this is the same as Equation (1). Hence the lines represented by Equations (1) and (2) are coincident. Therefore, Equations (1) and (2) have infinitely many solutions.\n\nPlot few points on the graph and verify it yourself.\n\nExample 3 : Champa went to a ‘Sale’ to purchase some pants and skirts. When her friends asked her how many of each she had bought, she answered, “The number of skirts is two less than twice the number of pants purchased. Also, the number of skirts is four less than four times the number of pants purchased”. Help her friends to find how many pants and skirts Champa bought.",

    "text": "### 4.1 Introduction\n\nIn Chapter 2, you have studied different types of polynomials. One type was the quadratic polynomial of the form $a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c .$ , $a \\neq 0$ . When we equate this polynomial to zero, we get a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations come up when we deal with many real-life situations.\n\nFor instance, suppose a charity trust decides to build a prayer hall having a carpet area of 300 square metres with its length one metre more than twice its breadth. What should be the length and breadth of the hall? Suppose the breadth of the hall is $x$ metres. Then, its length should be $( 2 x + 1 )$ metres. We can depict this information pictorially as shown in Fig. 4.1.\n\n![](images/724a8b3c7e530d7ffd56620333f12c1970e33ea69257d9d54e234432d4230b15.jpg)  \nFig. 4.1\n\nNow, area of the hall $= ( 2 x + 1 )$ . $x \\ : \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } = ( 2 x ^ { 2 } + x ) \\ : \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$\n\nSo, $2 x ^ { 2 } + x = 3 0 0$ (Given)\n\nTherefore, $2 x ^ { 2 } + x - 3 0 0 = 0$\n\nSo, the breadth of the hall should satisfy the equation $2 x ^ { 2 } + x - 3 0 0 = 0$ which is a quadratic equation.\n\nMany people believe that Babylonians were the first to solve quadratic equations. For instance, they knew how to find two positive numbers with a given positive sum and a given positive product, and this problem is equivalent to solving a quadratic equation of the form $x ^ { 2 } - p x + q = 0$ . Greek mathematician Euclid developed a geometrical approach for finding out lengths which, in our present day terminology, are solutions of quadratic equations. Solving of quadratic equations, in general form, is often credited to ancient Indian mathematicians. In fact, Brahmagupta (C.E.598–665) gave an explicit formula to solve a quadratic equation of the form $a x ^ { 2 } + b x = c$ . Later,\n\nSridharacharya (C.E. 1025) derived a formula, now known as the quadratic formula, (as quoted by Bhaskara II) for solving a quadratic equation by the method of completing the square. An Arab mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (about C.E. 800) also studied quadratic equations of different types. Abraham bar Hiyya Ha-Nasi, i n his book ‘Liber embadorum’ published in Europe in C.E. 1145 gave complete solutions of different quadratic equations.\n\nIn this chapter, you will study quadratic equations, and various ways of finding their roots. You will also see some applications of quadratic equations in daily life situations.",

Similarly, $2 x ^ { 2 } - 3 x ^ { + }$ $1 = 0$ $1 = 0 , 4 x - 3 x ^ { 2 } + 2 = 0$ and $1 - x ^ { 2 } + 3 0 0 = 0$ are also quadratic equations.\n\nIn fact, any equation of the form $p ( x ) = 0$ , where $p ( x )$ is a polynomial of degree 2, is a quadratic equation.

We say that 1 is a root of the quadratic equation $2 x ^ { 2 } - 3 x + 1 = 0 .$ . This also means that 1 is a zero of the quadratic polynomial $2 x ^ { 2 } - 3 x + 1$ .\n\nIn general, a real number $\\alpha$ is called a root of the quadratic equation $a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c = 0$ , $a \\neq 0$ if $a \\mathrm { ~ } \\mathrm { a } ^ { 2 } + b \\mathrm { a } + c = 0$ .

Some such examples are :\n\n(i) Reena applied for a job and got selected. She has been offered a job with a starting monthly salary of ` 8000, with an annual increment of ` 500 in her salary. Her salary (in `) for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . . years will be, respectively\n\n8000, 8500, 9000, . . . .\n\n(ii) The lengths of the rungs of a ladder decrease uniformly by 2 cm from bottom to top (see Fig. 5.1). The bottom rung is 45 cm in length. The lengths (in cm) of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . ., 8th rung from the bottom to the top are, respectively\n\n45, 43, 41, 39, 37, 35, 33, 31\n\n![](images/e5c614d1a2029ab29b77aa2965fc82da8ddb3f78728a19f2333895727d8c02a7.jpg)  \nFig. 5.1\n\n(iii) In a savings scheme, the amount becomes $\\frac { 5 } { 4 }$ times of itself after every 3 years. The maturity amount (in `) of an investment of ` 8000 after 3, 6, 9 and 12 years will be, respectively : 10000, 12500, 15625, 19531.25\n\n(iv) The number of unit squares in squares with side 1, 2, 3, . . . units (see Fig. 5.2) are, respectively 12, 22, 32, . . .\n\n![](images/8381767e85108296681d46484bc31b0246f8f756db8d6c23047b15e89a76eb1f.jpg)  \nFig. 5.2\n\n(v) Shakila puts $\\yen 100$ into her daughter’s money box when she was one year old and increased the amount by $\\yen 50$ every year. The amounts of money (in `) in the box on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, . . . birthday were\n\n100, 150, 200, 250, . . ., respectively.\n\n(vi) A pair of rabbits are too young to produce in their first month. In the second, and every subsequent month, they produce a new pair. Each new pair of rabbits produce a new pair in their second month and in every subsequent month (see Fig. 5.3). Assuming no rabbit dies, the number of pairs of rabbits at the start of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . ., 6th month, respectively are :\n\n![](images/14409328cbdf93b6f47ef74a459ef1079a31c5e47fafcfc6e25b2f55418c5a2b.jpg)  \nFig. 5.3\n\nIn the examples above, we observe some patterns. In some, we find that the succeeding terms are obtained by adding a fixed number, in other by multiplying with a fixed number, in another we find that they are squares of consecutive numbers, and so on.\n\nIn this chapter, we shall discuss one of these patterns in which succeeding terms are obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding terms. We shall also see how to find their nth terms and the sum of n consecutive terms, and use this knowledge in solving some daily life problems.",

This is called the general form of an AP.\n\nNote that in examples (a) to (e) above, there are only a finite number of terms. Such an AP is called a finite AP. Also note that each of these Arithmetic Progressions (APs) has a last term. The APs in examples (i) to (v) in this section, are not finite APs and so they are called infinite Arithmetic Progressions. Such APs do not have a last term.\n\nNow, to know about an AP, what is the minimum information that you need? Is it enough to know the first term? Or, is it enough to know only the common difference? You will find that you will need to know both – the first term a and the common difference $d$ .\n\nFor instance if the first term a is 6 and the common difference $d$ is 3, then the AP is 6, 9,12, 15, . . .\n\nand if $a$ is 6 and $d$ is – 3, then the AP is\n\n$$\n6, 3, 0, - 3, \\dots\n$$\n\nSimilarly, when\n\n$$\na = - 7, \\quad d = - 2, \\text {t h e} A P \\text {i s} - 7, - 9, - 1 1, - 1 3, \\dots\n$$\n\n$$\na = 1. 0, d = 0. 1, \\text {t h e A P i s} 1. 0, 1. 1, 1. 2, 1. 3, \\dots\n$$\n\n$$\na = 0, \\quad d = 1 \\frac {1}{2}, \\text {t h e A P i s} 0, 1 \\frac {1}{2}, 3, 4 \\frac {1}{2}, 6, \\dots\n$$\n\n$$\na = 2, \\quad d = 0, \\quad \\text {t h e A P i s} 2, 2, 2, 2, \\dots\n$$",

    "text": "So, if you know what $a$ and $d$ are, you can list the AP. What about the other way round? That is, if you are given a list of numbers can you say that it is an AP and then find $a$ and $d ?$ Since $a$ is the first term, it can easily be written. We know that in an AP, every succeeding term is obtained by adding $d$ to the preceding term. So, $d$ found by subtracting any term from its succeeding term, i.e., the term which immediately follows it should be same for an AP.\n\nFor example, for the list of numbers :\n\n$$\n6, 9, 1 2, 1 5, \\ldots ,\n$$\n\nWe have $a _ { { } _ { 2 } } - a _ { { } _ { 1 } } = 9 { } - 6 = 3 ,$\n\n$$\na _ {3} - a _ {2} = 1 2 - 9 = 3,\n$$\n\n$$\na _ {4} - a _ {3} = 1 5 - 1 2 = 3\n$$\n\nHere the difference of any two consecutive terms in each case is 3. So, the given list is an AP whose first term $a$ is 6 and common difference $d$ is 3.\n\nFor the list of numbers : $6 , 3 , 0 , - 3 , . . . ,$\n\n$$\na _ {2} - a _ {1} = 3 - 6 = - 3\n$$\n\n$$\na _ {3} - a _ {2} = 0 - 3 = - 3\n$$\n\n$$\na _ {4} - a _ {3} = - 3 - 0 = - 3\n$$\n\nSimilarly this is also an AP whose first term is 6 and the common difference is $- 3$ .\n\nIn general, for an AP $a _ { 1 } , a _ { 2 } , . . . , a _ { n } ,$ we have\n\n$$\nd = a _ {k + 1} - a _ {k}\n$$\n\nwhere $a _ { { } _ { k + 1 } }$ and $a _ { \\scriptscriptstyle k }$ are the $( k + 1 ) \\mathrm { t h }$ and the kth terms respectively.\n\nTo obtain $d$ in a given AP, we need not find all of $a _ { 2 } - a _ { 1 } , a _ { 3 } - a _ { 2 } , a _ { 4 } - a _ { 3 } , \\ldots .$ It is enough to find only one of them.\n\nConsider the list of numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, . . . . By looking at it, you can tell that the difference between any two consecutive terms is not the same. So, this is not an AP.",

    "text": "Looking at the pattern, we can say that the nth term $a _ { _ n } = a + ( n - 1 ) d .$ .\n\nSo, the nth term ${ \\pmb a } _ { n }$ of the AP with first term a and common difference $\\mathbf { \\Delta } _ { d }$ is given by $\\pmb { a } _ { n } = \\pmb { a } + \\left( \\pmb { n } - 1 \\right) \\pmb { d } .$\n\n${ \\pmb a } _ { n }$ is also called the general term of the AP. If there are $m$ terms in the AP, then ${ \\pmb { a } } _ { m }$\n\nrepresents the last term which is sometimes also denoted by l.\n\nLet us consider some examples.\n\nExample 3 : Find the 10th term of the AP : 2, 7, 12, . . .\n\nSolution : Here, a = 2, d = 7 – 2 = 5 and $n = ~ 1 0$ .\n\nWe have $a _ { _ n } = a + ( n - 1 ) d$\n\nSo, $a _ { 1 0 } = 2 + ( 1 0 - 1 ) \\times 5 = 2 + 4 5 = 4 7$\n\nTherefore, the 10th term of the given AP is 47.\n\nExample 4 : Which term of the AP : 21, 18, 15, . . . is – 81? Also, is any term 0? Give reason for your answer.\n\nSolution : Here, $a = 2 1$ , $d = 1 8 - 2 1 = - 3$ and $a _ { _ n } = - 8 1$ , and we have to find n.\n\nAs $a _ { _ n } = a + \\left( n - 1 \\right) d ,$\n\nwe have $- 8 1 = 2 1 + ( n - 1 ) ( - 3 )$\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l} - 8 1 = 2 4 - 3 n \\\\ - 1 0 5 = - 3 n \\\\ \\end{array}\n$$\n\nSo, $n = 3 5$\n\nTherefore, the 35th term of the given AP is – 81.\n\nNext, we want to know if there is any $n$ for which $a _ { _ n } = 0$ . If such an $n$ is there, then\n\n$$\n2 1 + (n - 1) (- 3) = 0,\n$$\n\ni.e., $3 ( n - 1 ) = 2 1$\n\ni.e.,\n\nSo, the eighth term is 0.\n\nExample 5 : Determine the AP whose 3rd term is 5 and the 7th term is 9.\n\nSolution : We have\n\n$$\na _ {3} = a + (3 - 1) d = a + 2 d = 5 \\tag {1}\n$$\n\nand $a _ { \\scriptscriptstyle 7 } = a + ( 7 - 1 ) d = a + 6 d = 9$ (2)\n\nSolving the pair of linear equations (1) and (2), we get\n\n$$\na = 3, d = 1\n$$",

Recall that two figures are said to be congruent, if they have the same shape and the same size. In this chapter, we shall study about those figures which have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. Two figures having the same shape (and not necessarily the same size) are called similar figures. In particular, we shall discuss the similarity of triangles and apply this knowledge in giving a simple proof of Pythagoras Theorem learnt earlier.\n\nCan you guess how heights of mountains (say Mount Everest) or distances of some long distant objects (say moon) have been found out? Do you think these have\n\n![](images/26f7f4d331eafd9615226bef181f4b590155981c8ba56f3b278bd1815fba14f6.jpg)\n\n![](images/aca462967b51ac009502f2e3f6d93a1007c3fe20dcc7b8948d9aa0677bff90f9.jpg)\n\nbeen measured directly with the help of a measuring tape? In fact, all these heights and distances have been found out using the idea of indirect measurements, which is based on the principle of similarity of figures (see Example 7, Q.15 of Exercise 6.3 and also Chapters 8 and 9 of this book)",

Are they congruent? Since all of them do not have the same radius, they are not congruent to each other. Note that some are congruent and some are not, but all of them have the same shape. So they all are, what we call, similar. Two similar figures have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. Therefore, all circles are similar. What about two (or more) squares or two (or more) equilateral triangles [see Fig. 6.1 (ii) and (iii)]? As observed in the case of circles, here also all squares are similar and all equilateral triangles are similar.\n\nFrom the above, we can say that all congruent figures are similar but the similar figures need not be congruent.\n\nCan a circle and a square be similar? Can a triangle and a square be similar? These questions can be answered by just looking at the figures (see Fig. 6.1). Evidently these figures are not similar.

These figures appear to be similar but we cannot be certain about it.Therefore, we must have some definition of similarity of figures and based on this definition some rules to decide whether the two given figures are similar or not. For this, let us look at the photographs given in Fig. 6.3:\n\n![](images/418017ea9868e3a7f462b51c6caaab3db6ed5d75f6d37762ba3d87e32e893ab0.jpg)\n\n![](images/25ee8ae82063ccce76c2b913542462c548520d4130eddae17e8371b0bba39003.jpg)\n\n![](images/fc2bd345541accfb9da5c086f13e83f8c909051359f9a41249c00d8052791b87.jpg)  \nFig. 6.3\n\nYou will at once say that they are the photographs of the same monument (Taj Mahal) but are in different sizes.

    "text": "What does the photographer do when she prints photographs of different sizes from the same negative? You must have heard about the stamp size, passport size and postcard size photographs. She generally takes a photograph on a small size film, say of 35mm size and then enlarges it into a bigger size, say 45mm (or $5 5 \\mathrm { m m } )$ ). Thus, if we consider any line segment in the smaller photograph (figure), its corresponding line segment in the bigger photograph (figure) will be ${ \\frac { 4 5 } { 3 5 } } \\left( \\operatorname { o r } { \\frac { 5 5 } { 3 5 } } \\right)$ of that of the line segment. This really means that every line segment of the smaller photograph is enlarged (increased) in the ratio 35:45 (or 35:55). It can also be said that every line segment of the bigger photograph is reduced (decreased) in the ratio 45:35 (or 55:35). Further, if you consider inclinations (or angles) between any pair of corresponding line segments in the two photographs of different sizes, you shall see that these inclinations(or angles) are always equal. This is the essence of the similarity of two figures and in particular of two polygons. We say that:\n\nTwo polygons of the same number of sides are similar, $i f ( i )$ their corresponding angles are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion).\n\nNote that the same ratio of the corresponding sides is referred to as the scale factor (or the Representative Fraction) for the polygons. You must have heard that world maps (i.e., global maps) and blue prints for the construction of a building are prepared using a suitable scale factor and observing certain conventions.\n\nIn order to understand similarity of figures more clearly, let us perform the following activity:\n\nActivity 1 : Place a lighted bulb at a point O on the ceiling and directly below it a table in your classroom. Let us cut a polygon, say a quadrilateral ABCD, from a plane cardboard and place this cardboard parallel to the ground between the lighted bulb and the table. Then a shadow of ABCD is cast on the table. Mark the outline of this shadow as $\\mathrm { { A ^ { \\prime } B ^ { \\prime } C ^ { \\prime } D ^ { \\prime } } }$ (see Fig.6.4).\n\nNote that the quadrilateral $\\mathrm { { A ^ { \\prime } B ^ { \\prime } C ^ { \\prime } D ^ { \\prime } } }$ is an enlargement (or magnification) of the quadrilateral ABCD. This is because of the property of light that light propogates in a straight line. You may also note that $\\mathbf { A ^ { \\prime } }$ lies on ray OA, $\\mathrm { B ^ { \\prime } }$ lies on ray OB, C¢\n\n![](images/0ef1a26449b8f1ef634fbc92529c7062d78c21e5adf2a235e80ccf57f55c809f.jpg)  \nFig. 6.4",

    "text": "What can you say about the similarity of two triangles?\n\nYou may recall that triangle is also a polygon. So, we can state the same conditions for the similarity of two triangles. That is:\n\nTwo triangles are similiar, if\n\n(i) their corresponding angles are equal and   \n(ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion).\n\nNote that if corresponding angles of two triangles are equal, then they are known as equiangular triangles. A famous Greek mathematician Thales gave an important truth relating to two equiangular triangles which is as follows:\n\nThe ratio of any two corresponding sides in two equiangular triangles is always the same.\n\nIt is believed that he had used a result called the Basic Proportionality Theorem (now known as the Thales Theorem) for the same.\n\nTo understand the Basic Proportionality Theorem, let us perform the following activity:\n\nActivity $2 :$ Draw any angle XAY and on its one arm AX, mark points (say five points) P, Q, D, R and B such that $\\mathrm { A P = P Q = Q D = D R = R B }$ .\n\nNow, through B, draw any line intersecting arm AY at C (see Fig. 6.9).\n\nAlso, through the point D, draw a line parallel to BC to intersect AC at E. Do you observe from your constructions that ${ \\frac { \\mathrm { A D } } { \\mathrm { D B } } } = { \\frac { 3 } { 2 } } ?$ Measure AE and\n\n![](images/cd7a956cbea80db0fd413241221a45233b640a0bf1cf9b3724c626b14c6c1fe2.jpg)  \nThales (640 – 546 B.C.)\n\n![](images/48f0760340ad0e57f6eb866223a0d834e01224e8a90d46d995449e8c1bcad3c3.jpg)  \nFig. 6.9\n\nEC. What about $\\frac { \\mathrm { A E } } { \\mathrm { E C } } ?$ Observe that $\\frac { \\mathrm { A E } } { \\mathrm { E C } }$ is also equal to $\\frac { 3 } { 2 }$ . Thus, you can see that in D ABC, DE $\\Vert \\mathrm { B C }$ and ${ \\frac { \\mathrm { A D } } { \\mathrm { D B } } } = { \\frac { \\mathrm { A E } } { \\mathrm { E C } } }$ . Is it a coincidence? No, it is due to the following theorem (known as the Basic Proportionality Theorem):\n\nTheorem 6.1 : If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle to intersect the other two sides in distinct points, the other two sides are divided in the same ratio.\n\nProof : We are given a triangle ABC in which a line parallel to side BC intersects other two sides AB and AC at D and E respectively (see Fig. 6.10).\n\nWe need to prove that $\\mathrm { \\frac { A D } { D B } } = \\mathrm { \\frac { A E } { E C } }$\n\nLet us join BE and CD and then draw DM ^ AC and EN ^ AB.\n\n![](images/7a98058a73fe8390931b6bedcc14b44d5aee6f4475acd6457388f29dab4945d6.jpg)  \nFig. 6.10",

However, on the basis of Theorems 6.3 and 6.4, you can now say that in case of similarity of the two triangles, it is not necessary to check both the conditions as one condition implies the other.\n\nLet us now recall the various criteria for congruency of two triangles learnt in Class IX. You may observe that SSS similarity criterion can be compared with the SSS congruency criterion.This suggests us to look for a similarity criterion comparable to SAS congruency criterion of triangles. For this, let us perform an activity.\n\nActivity 6 : Draw two triangles ABC and DEF such that $\\mathrm { A B } = 2 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ , $\\angle \\mathrm { \\bf ~ A } = 5 0 ^ { \\circ }$ , $\\mathbf { A C } = 4 \\mathbf { c m }$ , DE = 3 cm, $\\angle \\mathrm { D } = 5 0 ^ { \\circ }$ and DF = 6 cm (see Fig.6.27).\n\n![](images/63f806a55878df77ae110494b78d159ed1ba75059a6bc6c60150c30a23f38b90.jpg)\n\n![](images/45db1856924d45029b51b74463710721f547fbae0f9c1d2abdfda4eccee01fbe.jpg)  \nFig. 6.27\n\nHere, you may observe that ${ \\frac { \\mathrm { A B } } { \\mathrm { D E } } } = { \\frac { \\mathrm { A C } } { \\mathrm { D F } } }$ (each equal to $\\frac { 2 } { 3 } { \\cdot }$ ) and $\\angle \\mathrm { A }$ (included between the sides AB and AC) $= \\angle D$ (included between the sides DE and DF). That is, one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of another triangle and sides including these angles are in the same ratio (i.e., proportion).

    "text": "### 7.1 Introduction\n\nIn Class IX, you have studied that to locate the position of a point on a plane, we require a pair of coordinate axes. The distance of a point from the y-axis is called its $\\mathbf { \\nabla } _ { \\mathbf { x } } .$ -coordinate, or abscissa. The distance of a point from the $x$ -axis is called its y-coordinate, or ordinate. The coordinates of a point on the $x$ -axis are of the form $( x , 0 )$ , and of a point on the y-axis are of the form $( 0 , y )$ .\n\nHere is a play for you. Draw a set of a pair of perpendicular axes on a graph paper. Now plot the following points and join them as directed: Join the point A(4, 8) to B(3, 9) to C(3, 8) to $\\mathrm { D } ( 1 , 6 )$ to $\\operatorname { E } ( 1 , 5 )$ to F(3, 3) to G(6, 3) to H(8, 5) to I(8, 6) to J(6, 8) to K(6, 9) to L(5, 8) to A. Then join the points P(3.5, 7), Q (3, 6) and $\\mathrm { R } ( 4 , 6 )$ to form a triangle. Also join the points X(5.5, 7), Y(5, 6) and $Z ( 6 , 6 )$ to form a triangle. Now join S(4, 5), T(4.5, 4) and U(5, 5) to form a triangle. Lastly join S to the points (0, 5) and $( 0 , 6 )$ and join U to the points (9, 5) and (9, 6). What picture have you got?\n\nAlso, you have seen that a linear equation in two variables of the form $a x + b y + c = 0 .$ , $( a , b$ are not simultaneously zero), when represented graphically, gives a straight line. Further, in Chapter 2, you have seen the graph of $y = a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c \\left( a \\neq 0 \\right)$ , is a parabola. In fact, coordinate geometry has been developed as an algebraic tool for studying geometry of figures. It helps us to study geometry using algebra, and understand algebra with the help of geometry. Because of this, coordinate geometry is widely applied in various fields such as physics, engineering, navigation, seismology and art!\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn how to find the distance between the two points whose coordinates are given, and to find the area of the triangle formed by three given points. You will also study how to find the coordinates of the point which divides a line segment joining two given points in a given ratio.",

    "text": "Let us consider the following situation:\n\nA town B is located $3 6 \\mathrm { k m }$ east and $1 5 \\mathrm { k m }$ north of the town A. How would you find the distance from town A to town B without actually measuring it. Let us see. This situation can be represented graphically as shown in Fig. 7.1. You may use the Pythagoras Theorem to calculate this distance.\n\nNow, suppose two points lie on the $x$ -axis. Can we find the distance between them? For instance, consider two points $\\mathrm { A } ( 4 , 0 )$ and $\\mathrm { B } ( 6 , 0 )$ in Fig. 7.2. The points A and B lie on the $x$ -axis.\n\nFrom the figure you can see that $\\mathrm { O A } = 4$ units and $\\mathrm { O B } = 6$ units.\n\nTherefore, the distance of B from A, i.e., AB $= \\mathrm { O B } - \\mathrm { O A } = 6 - 4 = 2$ units.\n\nSo, if two points lie on the $x$ -axis, we can easily find the distance between them.\n\nNow, suppose we take two points lying on the $y .$ -axis. Can you find the distance between them. If the points ${ \\dot { \\mathrm { C } } } ( 0 , 3 )$ and $\\mathrm { D } ( 0 , 8 )$ lie on the $y .$ -axis, similarly we find that $\\mathrm { C D } = 8 - 3 = 5$ units (see Fig. 7.2).\n\n![](images/e8cfb7337681bf8af810b99a0fc27edb3f9c55dde47b099d22e7ea8e9546aace.jpg)  \nFig. 7.1\n\n![](images/fdeff311c204f075a0c567f93b588fddc9c7ee81cc9b3d4381e864d3f7c1a266.jpg)  \nFig. 7.2\n\nNext, can you find the distance of A from C (in Fig. 7.2)? Since $\\mathrm { O A } = 4$ units and $\\mathrm { O C } = 3$ units, the distance of A from C, i.e., $\\operatorname { A C } = { \\sqrt { 3 ^ { 2 } + 4 ^ { 2 } } } = 5$ units. Similarly, you can find the distance of B from $\\mathrm { D } = \\mathrm { B D } = 1 0$ units.\n\nNow, if we consider two points not lying on coordinate axis, can we find the distance between them? Yes! We shall use Pythagoras theorem to do so. Let us see an example.\n\nIn Fig. 7.3, the points $\\mathrm { P } ( 4 , 6 )$ and Q(6, 8) lie in the first quadrant. How do we use Pythagoras theorem to find the distance between them? Let us draw PR and QS perpendicular to the $x$ -axis from P and Q respectively. Also, draw a perpendicular from P on QS to meet QS at T. Then the coordinates of R and S are (4, 0) and (6, 0), respectively. So, ${ \\mathrm { R S } } = 2$ units. Also, $\\mathrm { Q S } = 8$ units and $\\mathrm { T S } = \\mathrm { P R } = 6$ units.",

    "text": "The ability to reason and think clearly is extremely useful in our daily life. For example, suppose a politician tells you, ‘If you are interested in a clean government, then you should vote for me.’ What he actually wants you to believe is that if you do not vote for him, then you may not get a clean government. Similarly, if an advertisement tells you, ‘The intelligent wear XYZ shoes’, what the company wants you to conclude is that if you do not wear XYZ shoes, then you are not intelligent enough. You can yourself observe that both the above statements may mislead the general public. So, if we understand the process of reasoning correctly, we do not fall into such traps unknowingly.\n\nThe correct use of reasoning is at the core of mathematics, especially in constructing proofs. In Class IX, you were introduced to the idea of proofs, and you actually proved many statements, especially in geometry. Recall that a proof is made up of several mathematical statements, each of which is logically deduced from a previous statement in the proof, or from a theorem proved earlier, or an axiom, or the hypotheses. The main tool, we use in constructing a proof, is the process of deductive reasoning.\n\nWe start the study of this chapter with a review of what a mathematical statement is. Then, we proceed to sharpen our skills in deductive reasoning using several examples. We shall also deal with the concept of negation and finding the negation of a given statement. Then, we discuss what it means to find the converse of a given statement. Finally, we review the ingredients of a proof learnt in Class IX by analysing the proofs of several theorems. Here, we also discuss the idea of proof by contradiction, which you have come across in Class IX and many other chapters of this book.",

    "text": "In Class IX, you were introduced to the idea of deductive reasoning. Here, we will work with many more examples which will illustrate how deductive reasoning is\n\nused to deduce conclusions from given statements that we assume to be true. The given statements are called ‘premises’ or ‘hypotheses’. We begin with some examples.\n\nExample $5 :$ Given that Bijapur is in the state of Karnataka, and suppose Shabana lives in Bijapur. In which state does Shabana live?\n\nSolution : Here we have two premises:\n\n(i) Bijapur is in the state of Karnataka\n\n(ii) Shabana lives in Bijapur\n\nFrom these premises, we deduce that Shabana lives in the state of Karnataka.\n\nExample $6 :$ Given that all mathematics textbooks are interesting, and suppose you are reading a mathematics textbook. What can we conclude about the textbook you are reading?\n\nSolution : Using the two premises (or hypotheses), we can deduce that you are reading an interesting textbook.\n\nExample 7 : Given that $y = - 6 x + 5$ , and suppose $x = 3$ . What is y?\n\nSolution : Given the two hypotheses, we get $y = - 6 ( 3 ) + 5 = - 1 3 .$\n\nExample $\\mathbf { 8 : }$ Given that ABCD is a parallelogram, and suppose $\\mathrm { A D } = 5 \\mathrm { c m } , \\mathrm { A B } = 7 \\mathrm { c m }$ (see Fig. A1.1). What can you conclude about the lengths of DC and BC?\n\nSolution : We are given that ABCD is a parallelogram. So, we deduce that all the properties that hold for a parallelogram hold for ABCD. Therefore, in particular,\n\n![](images/d82d61efab68bac27d6cc0b42e47ed3fdd3e17719fe2276b60e2a5da8e483856.jpg)  \nFig. A1.1\n\nthe property that ‘the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal to each other’, holds. Since we know AD $= 5$ cm, we can deduce that $\\mathrm { B C } = 5$ cm. Similarly, we deduce that $\\mathrm { D C } = 7 \\mathrm { c m }$ .\n\nRemark : In this example, we have seen how we will often need to find out and use properties hidden in a given premise.\n\nExample 9 : Given that $\\sqrt { p }$ is irrational for all primes $p$ , and suppose that 19423 is a prime.\n\nWhat can you conclude about ${ \\sqrt { 1 9 4 2 3 } } 2$\n\nSolution : We can conclude that $\\sqrt { 1 9 4 2 3 }$ is irrational.\n\nIn the examples above, you might have noticed that we do not know whether the hypotheses are true or not.

We can count these and tabulate our results as shown :\n\n![](images/826ebabe3249481ec9c7f78ec3522f669351c236adab801bf6a4d0ed663a5463.jpg)  \nFig. A1.2\n\n<table><tr><td>Number of points</td><td>Number of regions</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td></td></tr></table>\n\nSome of you might have come up with a formula predicting the number of regions given the number of points. From Class IX, you may remember that this intelligent guess is called a ‘conjecture’.\n\nSuppose your conjecture is that given $\\overrightarrow { \\mathbfit { n } } \\overrightarrow { \\mathbfit { n } } \\overrightarrow { \\mathbfit { n } }$ points on a circle, there are $2 ^ { n - 1 }$ mutually exclusive regions, created by joining the points with all possible lines. This seems an extremely sensible guess, and one can check that if $n = 5$ , we do get 16 regions. So, having verified this formula for 5 points, are you satisfied that for any $n$ points there are $2 ^ { n - 1 }$ regions? If so, how would you respond, if someone asked you, how you can be sure about this for $n = 2 5$ , say? To deal with such questions, you would need a proof which shows beyond doubt that this result is true, or a counter-example to show that this result fails for some $\\overrightarrow { \\mathbf { \\nabla } n } \\overrightarrow { \\mathbf { \\nabla } }$ . Actually, if you are patient and try it out for $n = 6$ , you will find that there are 31 regions, and for $n = 7$ there are 57 regions. So, $n =$ 6, is a counter-example to the conjecture above. This demonstrates the power of a counterexample. You may recall that in the Class IX we discussed that to disprove a statement, it is enough to come up with a single counter-example.\n\nYou may have noticed that we insisted on a proof regarding the number of regions in spite of verifying the result for $n = 1$ , 2, 3, 4 and 5. Let us consider a few more examples. You are familiar with the following result (given in Chapter 5): $1 + 2 + 3$ $+ \\ldots + n = { \\frac { n ( n + 1 ) } { 2 } }$ . To establish its validity, it is not enough to verify the result for $n = 1 , 2 , 3$ and so on, because there may be some $ { { ^ \\circ } n \\mathrm { \\ ' } }$ for which this result is not true (just as in the example above, the result failed for $n = 6$ ). What we need is a proof which establishes its truth beyond doubt. You shall learn a proof for the same in higher classes.",

    "text": "In this section, we discuss what it means to ‘negate’ a statement. Before we start, we would like to introduce some notation, which will make it easy for us to understand these concepts. To start with, let us look at a statement as a single unit, and give it a name. For example, we can denote the statement ‘It rained in Delhi on 1 September $2 0 0 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { b y } p$ . We can also write this by\n\n$p$ : It rained in Delhi on 1 September 2005.\n\nSimilarly, let us write\n\nq: All teachers are female.\n\nr: Mike’s dog has a black tail.\n\n$$\ns: 2 + 2 = 4.\n$$\n\nt : Triangle ABC is equilateral.\n\nThis notation now helps us to discuss properties of statements, and also to see how we can combine them.

    "text": "Each new statement in the table is a negation of the corresponding old statement. That is, $\\displaystyle { \\sim } p , \\sim q , \\sim r , \\sim s$ and ${ \\sim } t$ are negations of the statements $p , q , r , s$ and $t$ , respectively. Here, ${ \\sim } p$ is read as ‘not $p '$ . The statement ${ \\sim } p$ negates the assertion that the statement $p$ makes. Notice that in our usual talk we would simply mean ${ \\sim } p$ as ‘It did not rain in Delhi on 1 September 2005.’ However, we need to be careful while doing so. You might think that one can obtain the negation of a statement by simply inserting the word ‘not’ in the given statement at a suitable place. While this works in the case of $p$ , the difficulty comes when we have a statement that begins with ‘all’. Consider, for example, the statement $q$ : All teachers are female. We said the negation of this statement is ${ \\sim } q$ : It is false that all teachers are female. This is the same as the statement ‘There are some teachers who are males.’ Now let us see what happens if we simply insert ‘not’ in $q$ . We obtain the statement: ‘All teachers are not female’, or we can obtain the statement: ‘Not all teachers are female.’ The first statement can confuse people. It could imply (if we lay emphasis on the word ‘All’) that all teachers are male! This is certainly not the negation of $q$ . However, the second statement gives the meaning of ${ \\sim } q$ , i.e., that there is at least one teacher who is not a female. So, be careful when writing the negation of a statement!\n\nSo, how do we decide that we have the correct negation? We use the following criterion.\n\nLet p be a statement and ${ \\sim } p$ its negation. Then ~p is false whenever p is true, and ${ \\sim } p$ is true whenever p is false.\n\nFor example, if it is true that Mike’s dog has a black tail, then it is false that Mike’s dog does not have a black tail. If it is false that ‘Mike’s dog has a black tail’, then it is true that ‘Mike’s dog does not have a black tail’.\n\nSimilarly, the negations for the statements $s$ and $t$ are:\n\n$$\ns: 2 + 2 = 4; \\text {n e g a t i o n}, \\sim s: 2 + 2 \\neq 4.\n$$\n\nt: Triangle ABC is equilateral; negation, ${ \\sim } t { \\cdot }$ Triangle ABC is not equilateral.",

    "text": "We now investigate the notion of the converse of a statement. For this, we need the notion of a ‘compound’ statement, that is, a statement which is a combination of one or more ‘simple’ statements. There are many ways of creating compound statements, but we will focus on those that are created by connecting two simple statements with the use of the words ‘if’ and ‘then’. For example, the statement ‘If it is raining, then it is difficult to go on a bicycle’, is made up of two statements:\n\n$p$ : It is raining\n\n$q$ : It is difficult to go on a bicycle.\n\nUsing our previous notation we can say: If $p$ , then $q$ . We can also say $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { p } }$ implies $q ^ { , }$ , and denote it by $p \\Longrightarrow q$ .\n\nNow, supose you have the statement ‘If the water tank is black, then it contains potable water.’ This is of the form $p \\Longrightarrow q$ , where the hypothesis is $p$ (the water tank is black) and the conclusion is $q$ (the tank contains potable water). Suppose we interchange the hypothesis and the conclusion, what do we get? We get $q \\Rightarrow p$ , i.e., if the water in the tank is potable, then the tank must be black. This statement is called the converse of the statement $p \\Longrightarrow q$ .\n\nIn general, the converse of the statement $p \\Longrightarrow q$ is $q \\Rightarrow p$ , where $p$ and $q$ are statements. Note that $p \\Longrightarrow q$ and $q \\Rightarrow p$ are the converses of each other.\n\nExample 13 : Write the converses of the following statements :\n\n(i) If Jamila is riding a bicycle, then 17 August falls on a Sunday.   \n(ii) If 17 August is a Sunday, then Jamila is riding a bicycle.   \n(iii) If Pauline is angry, then her face turns red.   \n(iv) If a person has a degree in education, then she is allowed to teach.   \n(v) If a person has a viral infection, then he runs a high temperature.   \n(vi) If Ahmad is in Mumbai, then he is in India.   \n(vii) If triangle ABC is equilateral, then all its interior angles are equal.   \n(viii) If $x$ is an irrational number, then the decimal expansion of $x$ is non-terminating nonrecurring.   \n(ix) If $x - a$ is a factor of the polynomial $p ( x )$ , then $p ( a ) = 0$\n\nSolution : Each statement above is of the form $p \\Rightarrow q$ . So, to find the converse, we first identify $p$ and $q$ , and then write $q \\Longrightarrow p$ .",

    "text": "(i) $p$ : Jamila is riding a bicycle, and q: 17 August falls on a Sunday. Therefore, the converse is: If 17 August falls on a Sunday, then Jamila is riding a bicycle.   \n(ii) This is the converse of (i). Therefore, its converse is the statement given in (i) above.   \n(iii) If Pauline’s face turns red, then she is angry.   \n(iv) If a person is allowed to teach, then she has a degree in education.   \n(v) If a person runs a high temperature, then he has a viral infection.   \n(vi) If Ahmad is in India, then he is in Mumbai.   \n(vii) If all the interior angles of triangle ABC are equal, then it is equilateral.   \n(viii) If the decimal expansion of $x$ is non-terminating non-recurring, then $x$ is an irrational number.   \n(ix) If $p ( a ) = 0$ , then $x - a$ is a factor of the polynomial $p ( x )$\n\nNotice that we have simply written the converse of each of the statements above without worrying if they are true or false. For example, consider the following statement: If Ahmad is in Mumbai, then he is in India. This statement is true. Now consider the converse: If Ahmad is in India, then he is in Mumbai. This need not be true always – he could be in any other part of India.\n\nIn mathematics, especially in geometry, you will come across many situations where $p \\Longrightarrow q$ is true, and you will have to decide if the converse, i.e., $q \\Rightarrow p$ , is also true.\n\nExample 14 : State the converses of the following statements. In each case, also decide whether the converse is true or false.\n\n(i) If $n$ is an even integer, then $2 n + 1$ is an odd integer.   \n(ii) If the decimal expansion of a real number is terminating, then the number is rational.   \n(iii) If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then each pair of corresponding angles is equal.   \n(iv) If each pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral is equal, then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.   \n(v) If two triangles are congruent, then their corresponding angles are equal.",

    "text": "So far, in all our examples, we used direct arguments to establish the truth of the results. We now explore ‘indirect’ arguments, in particular, a very powerful tool in mathematics known as ‘proof by contradiction’. We have already used this method in Chapter 1 to establish the irrationality of several numbers and also in other chapters to prove some theorems. Here, we do several more examples to illustrate the idea.\n\nBefore we proceed, let us explain what a contradiction is. In mathematics, a contradiction occurs when we get a statement $p$ such that $p$ is true and ${ \\sim } p$ , its negation, is also true. For example,\n\np: $x = \\frac { a } { b }$ , where $a$ and $b$ are coprime.\n\nq: 2 divides both $ { { ^ \\circ } } a ^ { \\prime }$ and $^ { \\circ } b ^ { \\prime }$ .\n\nIf we assume that $p$ is true and also manage to show that $q$ is true, then we have arrived at a contradiction, because $q$ implies that the negation of $\\dot { p }$ is true. If you remember, this is exactly what happened when we tried to prove that $\\sqrt { 2 }$ is irrational (see Chapter 1).\n\nHow does proof by contradiction work? Let us see this through a specific example.\n\nSuppose we are given the following :\n\nAll women are mortal. A is a woman. Prove that A is mortal.\n\nEven though this is a rather easy example, let us see how we can prove this by contradiction.\n\nl Let us assume that we want to establish the truth of a statement $p$ (here we want to show that $p \\colon ^ { \\bullet } \\mathbf { A }$ is mortal’ is true).\n\nl So, we begin by assuming that the statement is not true, that is, we assume that the negation of $p$ is true (i.e., A is not mortal).   \nWe then proceed to carry out a series of logical deductions based on the truth of the negation of $p$ . (Since A is not mortal, we have a counter-example to the statement ‘All women are mortal.’ Hence, it is false that all women are mortal.)   \nIf this leads to a contradiction, then the contradiction arises because of our faulty assumption that $p$ is not true. (We have a contradiction, since we have shown that the statement ‘All women are mortal’ and its negation, ‘Not all women are mortal’ is true at the same time. This contradiction arose, because we assumed that A is not mortal.)   \nl Therefore, our assumption is wrong, i.e., $p$ has to be true. (So, A is mortal.)\n\nLet us now look at examples from mathematics.\n\nExample 15 : The product of a non-zero rational number and an irrational number is irrational.\n\nSolution :",

    "text": "The National Curriculum Framework 2005, recommends that children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a childcentred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\n\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\n\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\n\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in Science and Mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisors for this book, Professor P. Sinclair of IGNOU, New Delhi and Professor G.P. Dikshit (Retd.) of Lucknow University, Lucknow for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible. We are",

    "text": "There is perhaps nothing which so occupies the middle position of mathematics as trigonometry.\n\n– J.F. Herbart (1890)\n\n### 8.1 Introduction\n\nYou have already studied about triangles, and in particular, right triangles, in your earlier classes. Let us take some examples from our surroundings where right triangles can be imagined to be formed. For instance :\n\n1. Suppose the students of a school are visiting Qutub Minar. Now, if a student is looking at the top of the Minar, a right triangle can be imagined to be made, as shown in Fig 8.1. Can the student find out the height of the Minar, without actually measuring it?\n\n2. Suppose a girl is sitting on the balcony of her house located on the bank of a river. She is looking down at a flower pot placed on a stair of a temple situated nearby on the other bank of the river. A right triangle is imagined to be made in this situation as shown in Fig.8.2. If you know the height at which the person is sitting, can you find the width of the river?\n\n![](images/f1885084ceaedbeea0289ad209bbff7207d36646b3fafa5bef2ea7766d097e2f.jpg)  \nFig. 8.1\n\n![](images/435419aee4c7a08a647d2556989ccfeac6dac68323224b8621a32d066787ae98.jpg)  \nFig. 8.2\n\n3. Suppose a hot air balloon is flying in the air. A girl happens to spot the balloon in the sky and runs to her mother to tell her about it. Her mother rushes out of the house to look at the balloon.Now when the girl had spotted the balloon intially it was at point A. When both the mother and daughter came out to see it, it had already travelled to another point B. Can you find the altitude of B from the ground?\n\n![](images/62d039df97602951d5c58972b9e13c4e5f4f030e3e97eb829f3813cd0dee847b.jpg)  \nFig. 8.3\n\nIn all the situations given above, the distances or heights can be found by using some mathematical techniques, which come under a branch of mathematics called ‘trigonometry’. The word ‘trigonometry’ is de rived from the Gre ek words ‘tri’ (meaning three), ‘gon’ (meaning sides) and ‘metron’ (meaning measure). In fact, trigonometry is the study of relationships between the sides and angles of a triangle. The earliest known work on trigonometry was recorded in Egypt and Babylon. Early astronomers used it to find out the distances of the stars and planets from the Earth. Even today, most of the technologically advanced methods used in Engineering and Physical Sciences are based on trigonometrical concepts.\n\nIn this chapter, we will study some ratios of the sides of a right triangle with respect to its acute angles, called trigonometric ratios of the angle. We will restrict our discussion to acute angles only. However, these ratios can be extended to other angles also. We will also define the trigonometric ratios for angles of measure $0 ^ { \\circ }$ and $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ . We will calculate trigonometric ratios for some specific angles and establish some identities involving these ratios, called trigonometric identities.",

Here, $\\angle C \\mathrm { A B }$ (or, in brief, angle A) is an acute angle. Note the position of the side BC with respect to angle A. It faces $\\angle \\mathbf { A }$ . We call it the side opposite to angle A. AC is the hypotenuse of the right triangle and the side A B i s a par t of  A. So, we call it the side adjacent to angle A.\n\n![](images/66f173af835c02ed6278f0097e5ace1d627d2a972273d501774cc68d3d90437c.jpg)  \nFig. 8.4\n\nNote that the position of sides change when you consider angle C in place of A (see Fig. 8.5).\n\nYou have studied the concept of ‘ratio’ in your earlier classes.

(See Fig. 8.5)\n\nThe first use of the idea of ‘sine’ in the way we use it today was in the work Aryabhatiyam by Aryabhata, in A.D. 500. Aryabhata used the word ardha-jya for the half-chord, which was shortened to jya or jiva in due course. When the Aryabhatiyam was translated into Arabic, the word jiva was retained as it is. The word jiva was translated into sinus, which means curve, when the Arabic version was translated into Latin. Soon the word sinus, also used as sine, became common in mathematical texts throughout Europe. An English Professor of astronomy Edmund Gunter (1581– 1626), first used the abbreviated notation ‘sin’.\n\n![](images/c2ba839ab25e6ed3af63a1288e60c852454f297be6fa38caff641a4f239bdcf4.jpg)  \nAryabhata C.E. 476 – 550\n\nThe origin of the terms ‘cosine’ and ‘tangent’ was much later. The cosine function arose from the need to compute the sine of the complementary angle. Aryabhatta called it kotijya. The name cosinus originated with Edmund Gunter. In 1674, the English Mathematician Sir Jonas Moore first used the abbreviated notation ‘cos’.\n\nRemark : Note that the symbol sin A is used as an abbreviation for ‘the sine of the angle A’. sin A is not the product of ‘sin’ and A. ‘sin’ separated from A has no meaning. Similarly, cos A is not the product of ‘cos’ and A. Similar interpretations follow for other trigonometric ratios also.\n\nNow, if we take a point P on the hypotenuse AC or a point Q on AC extended, of the right triangle ABC and draw PM perpendicular to AB and QN perpendicular to AB extended (see Fig. 8.6), how will the trigonometric ratios of  A in ' PAM differ from those of  A in $\\Delta$ CAB or from those of  A in ' QAN?\n\n![](images/6a5b5a0fd23ed04e9704948ba8a738c3440ffaade0a9abecd936aee655bc364d.jpg)  \nFig. 8.6",

    "text": "To answer this, first look at these triangles. Is $\\Delta$ PAM similar to ' CAB? From Chapter 6, recall the AA similarity criterion. Using the criterion, you will see that the triangles PAM and CAB are similar. Therefore, by the property of similar triangles, the corresponding sides of the triangles are proportional.\n\nSo, we have\n\n$$\n\\frac {\\mathrm {A M}}{\\mathrm {A B}} = \\frac {\\mathrm {A P}}{\\mathrm {A C}} = \\frac {\\mathrm {M P}}{\\mathrm {B C}}.\n$$\n\nFrom this, we find ${ \\frac { \\mathrm { M P } } { \\mathrm { A P } } } = { \\frac { \\mathrm { B C } } { \\mathrm { A C } } } = \\sin { \\mathrm { A } } .$\n\nSimilarly, ${ \\frac { \\mathrm { A M } } { \\mathrm { A P } } } = { \\frac { \\mathrm { A B } } { \\mathrm { A C } } } = \\cos \\mathrm { A }$ , ${ \\frac { \\mathrm { M P } } { \\mathrm { A M } } } = { \\frac { \\mathrm { B C } } { \\mathrm { A B } } } =$ tan A and so on.\n\nThis shows that the trigonometric ratios of angle A in $\\Delta$ PAM not differ from those of angle A in $\\Delta$ CAB.\n\nIn the same way, you should check that the value of sin A (and also of other trigonometric ratios) remains the same in $\\Delta$ QAN also.\n\nFrom our observations, it is now clear that the values of the trigonometric ratios of an angle do not vary with the lengths of the sides of the triangle, if the angle remains the same.\n\nNote : For the sake of convenience, we may write $\\sin ^ { 2 } \\mathrm { A }$ , $\\cos ^ { 2 } \\mathsf { A }$ , etc., in place of (sin A)2, (cos A)2, etc., respectively.

Similar conventions hold for the other trigonometric ratios as well. Sometimes, the Greek letter T (theta) is also used to denote an angle.\n\nWe have defined six trigonometric ratios of an acute angle. If we know any one of the ratios, can we obtain the other ratios?

    "text": "### 9.1 Heights and Distances\n\nIn the previous chapter, you have studied about trigonometric ratios. In this chapter, you will be studying about some ways in which trigonometry is used in the life around you.\n\nLet us consider Fig. 8.1 of prvious chapter, which is redrawn below in Fig. 9.1.\n\n![](images/0cc1d5700c7078a09845e7c896f49e4c79c1852c52a75c3a423baa6167c8ba17.jpg)\n\n![](images/e629374d53ebe3d776f0b0546469bd1052848a939c2911e02c9326dd0c331986.jpg)  \nFig. 9.1\n\nIn this figure, the line AC drawn from the eye of the student to the top of the minar is called the line of sight. The student is looking at the top of the minar. The angle BAC, so formed by the line of sight with the horizontal, is called the angle of elevation of the top of the minar from the eye of the student.\n\nThus, the line of sight is the line drawn from the eye of an observer to the point in the object viewed by the observer. The angle of elevation of the point viewed is\n\nthe angle formed by the line of sight with the horizontal when the point being viewed is above the horizontal level, i.e., the case when we raise our head to look at the object (see Fig. 9.2).\n\n![](images/4a477d40647ae33445e61197a0c358a91e3cd5bbd86dc128ce11637a3679f72b.jpg)  \nFig. 9.2\n\nNow, consider the situation given in Fig. 9.3. The girl sitting on the balcony is looking down at a flower pot placed on a stair of the temple. In this case, the line of sight is below the horizontal level. The angle so formed by the line of sight with the horizontal is called the angle of depression.\n\nThus, the angle of depression of a point on the object being viewed is the angle formed by the line of sight with the horizontal when the point is below the horizontal level, i.e., the case when we lower our head to look at the point being viewed (see Fig. 9.3).\n\n![](images/f53221cfffdc83f82daec630e492a46ed4b6145a4a2c9ee64009255f1cedca6f.jpg)  \nFig. 9.3\n\nNow, you may identify the lines of sight, and the angles so formed in Fig. 9.3. Are they angles of elevation or angles of depression?\n\nLet us refer to Fig. 9.1 again. If you want to find the height CD of the minar without actually measuring it, what information do you need? You would need to know the following:\n\n(i) the distance DE at which the student is standing from the foot of the minar\n\n(ii) the angle of elevation, $\\angle \\mathrm { B A C }$ , of the top of the minar   \n(iii) the height AE of the student.\n\nAssuming that the above three conditions are known, how can we determine the height of the minar?\n\nIn the figure, $\\mathrm { C D = C B + B D } .$ . Here, $\\mathrm { B D } { = } \\mathrm { A E }$ , which is the height of the student.\n\nTo find BC, we will use trigonometric ratios of  BAC or  A.",

    "text": "In ' ABC, the side BC is the opposite side in relation to the known  A. Now, which of the trigonometric ratios can we use? Which one of them has the two values that we have and the one we need to determine? Our search narrows down to using either tan A or cot A, as these ratios involve AB and BC.\n\nTherefore, tan $\\mathrm { A } { = } { \\frac { \\mathrm { B C } } { \\mathrm { A B } } }$ or cot A = $\\mathrm { A } { = } { \\frac { \\mathrm { A B } } { \\mathrm { B C } } }$ which on solving would give us BC.\n\nBy adding AE to BC, you will get the height of the minar.\n\nNow let us explain the process, we have just discussed, by solving some problems.\n\nExample 1 : A tower stands vertically on the ground. From a point on the ground, which is 15 m away from the foot of the tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the tower is found to be $6 0 ^ { \\circ }$ . Find the height of the tower.\n\nSolution : First let us draw a simple diagram to represent the problem (see Fig. 9.4). Here AB represents the tower, CB is the distance of the point from the tower a n d\n\n$\\angle \\mathrm { A C B }$ is the angle of elevation. We need to determine the height of the tower, i.e., AB. Also, ACB is a triangle, right-angled at B.\n\nTo solve the problem, we choose the trigonometric ratio tan $6 0 ^ { \\circ }$ (or cot $6 0 ^ { \\circ }$ ), as the ratio involves AB and BC.\n\nNow, tan 60° = AB\n\ni.e., 3 AB\n\ni.e.,\n\n![](images/b28a6a7a5714ddb41301a01678b1f51f08b606ccc51dcf61b722784556ef7ece.jpg)  \nFig. 9.4\n\nHence, the height of the tower is $1 5 { \\sqrt { 3 } } { \\mathrm { ~ m ~ } }$ .\n\nExample 2 : An electrician has to repair an electric fault on a pole of height $5 \\mathrm { m }$ . She needs to reach a point $1 . 3 \\mathrm { m }$ below the top of the pole to undertake the repair work (see Fig. 9.5). What should be the length of the ladder that she should use which, when inclined at an angle of $6 0 ^ { \\circ }$ to the horizontal, would enable her to reach the required position? Also, how far from the foot of the pole should she place the foot of the ladder? (You may take ${ \\sqrt { 3 } } = 1 . 7 3 )$\n\nSolution : In Fig. 9.5, the electrician is required to reach the point B on the pole AD.\n\nSo, $\\mathrm { B D } = \\mathrm { A D } - \\mathrm { A B } = ( 5 - 1 . 3 ) \\mathrm { m } = 3 . 7 \\mathrm { m } .$",

The angle of elevation of the top of the chimney from her eyes is $4 5 ^ { \\circ }$ .

Find the height of the tower.\n\nSolution : In Fig. 9.8, AB is the tower and BC is the length of the shadow when the Sun’s altitude is $6 0 ^ { \\circ }$ , i.e., the angle of elevation of the top of the tower from the tip of the shadow is $6 0 ^ { \\circ }$ and DB is the length of the shadow, when the angle of elevation is $3 0 ^ { \\circ }$ .\n\n![](images/d99eb0aa18ee3e63ea70e240cc288317fbf00c7545c7d839fbc710aa3d8e125f.jpg)  \nFig. 9.8\n\nNow, let AB be $h \\textrm { m }$ and BC be x m.

    "text": "### 10.1 Introduction\n\nYou have studied in Class IX that a circle is a collection of all points in a plane which are at a constant distance (radius) from a fixed point (centre). You have also studied various terms related to a circle like chord, segment, sector, arc etc. Let us now examine the different situations that can arise when a circle and a line are given in a plane.\n\nSo, let us consider a circle and a line PQ. There can be three possibilities given in Fig. 10.1 below:\n\n![](images/68b1939c759970a43fd7a7f48295aff9e0ef67442676975687c2a77e69fc41af.jpg)  \n(i\n\n![](images/acd1b8ccb34f1aca963a7426fb3a6a1f004d67d6485ac2dee92f25ccc85f8a84.jpg)  \n(ii)\n\n![](images/a8eab30fa37a227c7ba6a44b6d595b5de059fbee2a90e3a990243d3b32a13c2b.jpg)  \n  \nFig. 10.1\n\nIn Fig. 10.1 (i), the line PQ and the circle have no common point. In this case, PQ is called a non-intersecting line with respect to the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (ii), there are two common points A and B that the line PQ and the circle have. In this case, we call the line PQ a secant of the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (iii), there is only one point A which is common to the line PQ and the circle. In this case, the line is called a tangent to the circle.\n\nYou might have seen a pulley fitted over a well which is used in taking out water from the well. Look at Fig. 10.2. Here the rope on both sides of the pulley, if considered as a ray, is like a tangent to the circle representing the pulley.\n\nIs there any position of the line with respect to the circle other than the types given above? You can see that there cannot be any other type of position of the line with respect to the circle. In this chapter, we will study about the existence of the tangents to a circle and also study some of their properties.\n\n![](images/53fbbd3a3d1986fc5de7e370d79146ea78e7815ab19c0ed61b9bb230cd55806d.jpg)  \nFig. 10.2",

    "text": "In the previous section, you have seen that a tangent* to a circle is a line that intersects the circle at only one point.\n\nTo understand the existence of the tangent to a circle at a point, let us perform the following activities:\n\nActivity 1 : Take a circular wire and attach a straight wire AB at a point P of the circular wire so that it can rotate about the point P in a plane. Put the system on a table and gently rotate the wire AB about the point P to get different positions of the straight wire [see Fig. 10.3(i)].\n\nIn various positions, the wire intersects the circular wire at P and at another point $\\mathrm { Q } _ { \\mathrm { l } }$ or $\\mathrm { Q } _ { 2 }$ or $\\mathrm { Q } _ { 3 }$ , etc. In one position, you will see that it will intersect the circle at the point P only (see position $\\mathrm { A ^ { \\prime } B ^ { \\prime } }$ of AB). This shows that a tangent exists at the point P of the circle. On rotating further, you can observe that in all other positions of AB, it will intersect the circle at P and at another point, say $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ or $\\mathsf { R } _ { 2 }$ or $\\mathrm { R } _ { 3 }$ , etc. So, you can observe that there is only one tangent at a point of the circle.\n\n![](images/16435db1ce4135fbe9bb118b862237f907668276a7415bcc03277b5e8b2b4d2f.jpg)  \nFig. 10.3 (i)\n\nWhile doing activity above, you must have observed that as the position AB moves towards the position $\\mathbf A ^ { \\prime } \\mathbf B ^ { \\prime }$ , the common point, say $\\mathrm { Q } _ { \\mathrm { l } }$ , of the line AB and the circle gradually comes nearer and nearer to the common point P. Ultimately, it coincides with the point P in the position $\\mathrm { A ^ { \\prime } B ^ { \\prime } }$ of AccBcc. Again note, what happens if ‘AB’ is rotated rightwards about P? The common point $\\mathrm { R } _ { 3 }$ gradually comes nearer and nearer to P and ultimately coincides with P. So, what we see is:\n\nThe tangent to a circle is a special case of the secant, when the two end points of its corresponding chord coincide.",

    "text": "Activity ${ \\mathfrak { Z } } :$ On a paper, draw a circle and a secant PQ of the circle. Draw various lines parallel to the secant on both sides of it. You will find that after some steps, the length of the chord cut by the lines will gradually decrease, i.e., the two points of intersection of the line and the circle are coming closer and closer [see Fig. 10.3(ii)]. In one case, it becomes zero on one side of the secant and in another case, it becomes zero on the other side of the secant. See the positions $\\mathrm { P ^ { \\prime } } \\mathrm { Q ^ { \\prime } }$ and $\\mathrm { P ^ { \\prime \\prime } } \\mathrm { Q ^ { \\prime \\prime } }$ of the secant in Fig. 10.3 (ii). These are the tangents to the circle parallel to the given secant PQ. This also helps you to see that there cannot be more than two tangents parallel to a given secant.\n\n![](images/fb7a75d91757fcb16720b0ffbd92a1a634f213765e32faf9fe87de44e1d2be2c.jpg)  \nFig. 10.3 (ii)\n\nThis activity also establishes, what you must have observed, while doing Activity 1, namely, a tangent is the secant when both of the end points of the corresponding chord coincide.\n\nThe common point of the tangent and the circle is called the point of contact [the point A in Fig. 10.1 (iii)]and the tangent is said to touch the circle at the common point.\n\nNow look around you. Have you seen a bicycle or a cart moving? Look at its wheels. All the spokes of a wheel are along its radii. Now note the position of the wheel with respect to its movement on the ground. Do you see any tangent anywhere? (See Fig. 10.4). In fact, the wheel moves along a line which is a tangent to the circle representing the wheel. Also, notice that in all positions, the radius through the point of contact with the ground appears to be at right angles to the tangent (see Fig. 10.4). We shall now prove this property of the tangent.\n\n![](images/d06f7d9835aee176ed001aacbb296915cf6cf8d0ed5f96abfbab6b012d3d1142.jpg)  \nFig. 10.4\n\nTheorem 10.1 : The tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the radius through the point of contact.\n\nProof : We are given a circle with centre O and a tangent XY to the circle at a point P. We need to prove that OP is perpendicular to XY.\n\nTake a point Q on XY other than P and join OQ (see Fig. 10.5).\n\nThe point Q must lie outside the circle. (Why? Note that if Q lies inside the circle, XY will become a secant and not a tangent to the circle). Therefore, OQ is longer than the radius OP of the circle. That is,\n\n$$\nO Q > O P.\n$$\n\nSince this happens for every point on the line XY except the point P, OP is the shortest of all the distances of the point O to the points of XY. So OP is perpendicular to XY. (as shown in Theorem A1.7.)",

    "text": "To get an idea of the number of tangents from a point on a circle, let us perform the following activity:\n\nActivity $3 :$ Draw a circle on a paper. Take a point P inside it. Can you draw a tangent to the circle through this point? You will find that all the lines through this point intersect the circle in two points. So, it is not possible to draw any tangent to a circle through a point inside it [see Fig. 10.6 (i)].\n\nNext take a point P on the circle and draw tangents through this point. You have already observed that there is only one tangent to the circle at such a point [see Fig. 10.6 (ii)].\n\nFinally, take a point P outside the circle and try to draw tangents to the circle from this point. What do you observe? You will find that you can draw exactly two tangents to the circle through this point [see Fig. 10.6 (iii)].\n\nWe can summarise these facts as follows:\n\nCase 1 : There is no tangent to a circle passing through a point lying inside the circle.\n\nCase 2 : There is one and only one tangent to a circle passing through a point lying on the circle.\n\nCase 3 : There are exactly two tangents to a circle through a point lying outside the circle.\n\nIn Fig. 10.6 (iii), $\\mathrm { T } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } }$ and $\\mathrm { T } _ { 2 }$ are the points of contact of the tangents $\\mathrm { P T _ { 1 } }$ and $\\mathrm { P T } _ { 2 }$ respectively.\n\nThe length of the segment of the tangent from the external point P and the point of contact with the circle is called the length of the tangent from the point P to the circle.\n\n![](images/00769eeb3d931a85378443b394ca7340a8aff32da97cd0c5e2eead0a1c68f1c7.jpg)  \n(i)\n\n![](images/64fb948b730edc5e3a64d0a8068eafcc739a5321e69e70b91b6117d8e3286971.jpg)  \n(ii)\n\n![](images/427247ee463aa184d988b189c6083f53c06367694ede21d376a61c5f4d48f415.jpg)  \n(iii)   \nFig. 10.6\n\nNote that in Fig. 10.6 (iii), $\\mathrm { P T _ { 1 } }$ and $\\mathrm { P T } _ { 2 }$ are the lengths of the tangents from P to the circle.

    "text": "### 11.1 Areas of Sector and Segment of a Circle\n\nYou have already come across the terms sector and segment of a circle in your earlier classes. Recall that the portion (or part) of the circular region enclosed by two radii and the corresponding arc is called a sector of the circle and the portion (or part) of the circular region enclosed between a chord and the corresponding arc is called a segment of the circle. Thus, in Fig. 11.1, shaded region OAPB is a sector of the circle with centre O.  AOB is called the\n\n![](images/2b188821c509277e35b9011ccdca291bb2da935ce00902ebd526e92718115868.jpg)  \nFig. 11.1\n\nangle of the sector. Note that in this figure, unshaded region OAQB is also a sector of the circle. For obvious reasons, OAPB is called the minor sector and OAQB is called the major sector. You can also see that angle of the major sector is $3 6 0 ^ { \\circ } - \\angle \\mathrm { A O B }$ .\n\nNow, look at Fig. 11.2 in which AB is a chord of the circle with centre O. So, shaded region APB is a segment of the circle. You can also note that unshaded region AQB is another segment of the circle formed by the chord AB. For obvious reasons, APB is called the minor segment and AQB is called the major segment.\n\nRemark : When we write ‘segment’ and ‘sector’ we will mean the ‘minor segment’ and the ‘minor sector’ respectively, unless stated otherwise.\n\n![](images/b626979edb067d78da9700eff7ad5889f95408c3e73e9641d46e8f9f861db565.jpg)  \nFig. 11.2\n\nNow with this knowledge, let us try to find some relations (or formulae) to calculate their areas.\n\nLet OAPB be a sector of a circle with centre O and radius r (see Fig. 11.3). Let the degree measure of  AOB be T.\n\nYou know that area of a circle (in fact of a circular region or disc) is $\\pi r ^ { 2 }$ .\n\nIn a way, we can consider this circular region to be a sector forming an angle of $3 6 0 ^ { \\circ }$ (i.e., of degree measure 360) at the centre O. Now by applying the Unitary Method, we can arrive at the area of the sector OAPB as follows:\n\n![](images/38f4078a524b6cceaf26959d6e3f146d784b14a1a5cf4671b3d95fabe39bf4bb.jpg)  \nFig. 11.3\n\nWhen degree measure of the angle at the centre is 360, area of the sector $= \\pi r ^ { 2 }$\n\nSo, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is 1, area of the ${ \\mathrm { s e c t o r } } = { \\frac { \\pi r ^ { 2 } } { 3 6 0 } } .$\n\nTherefore, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is T, area of the ${ \\mathrm { s e c t o r } } = { \\frac { \\pi r ^ { 2 } } { 3 6 0 } } \\times \\theta = { \\frac { \\theta } { 3 6 0 } } \\times \\pi r ^ { 2 } .$ 2S r 2ru S .",

Yes. Again, by applying the Unitary Method and taking the whole length of the circle (of angle $3 6 0 ^ { \\circ }$ ) as $2 \\pi r _ { \\frac { } { } }$ , we can obtain the required length of the arc APB as $\\frac { \\theta } { 3 6 0 } \\times 2 \\pi r$ .\n\n![](images/c324602ee897b89a25181680920d9aa9366ef468b68c6266ac63345d86ccb2d4.jpg)  \nFig. 11.4\n\nSo, length of an arc of a sector of angle $\\theta = \\frac { \\theta } { 3 6 0 } \\times 2 \\pi r$\n\nNow let us take the case of the area of the segment APB of a\n\ncircle with centre O and radius $r$ (see Fig. 11.4).

Is it in the shape of any of the four basic solids mentioned above? You may guess that it is made of a cylinder with two hemispheres as its ends.\n\n![](images/783063626290dd0dd33d41abac260b66ab4b3319a4469db7160a950f922a1d66.jpg)  \nFig. 12.2\n\nAgain, you may have seen an object like the one in Fig. 12.3. Can you name it? A test tube, right! You would have used one in your science laboratory. This tube is also a combination of a cylinder and a hemisphere. Similarly, while travelling, you may have seen some big and beautiful buildings or monuments made up of a combination of solids mentioned above.\n\nIf for some reason you wanted to find the surface areas, or volumes, or capacities of such objects, how would you do it? We cannot classify these under any of the solids you have already studied.\n\n![](images/a3dd34b8ccaeba3123acd8aa6d90f53c4eb81d9a6ce69a3bc7378b6c639c71bd.jpg)  \nFig. 12.3\n\nIn this chapter, you will see how to find surface areas and volumes of such objects.",

    "text": "Let us consider the container seen in Fig. 12.2. How do we find the surface area of such a solid? Now, whenever we come across a new problem, we first try to see, if we can break it down into smaller problems, we have earlier solved. We can see that this solid is made up of a cylinder with two hemispheres stuck at either end. It would look like what we have in Fig. 12.4, after we put the pieces all together.\n\n![](images/74c1b059b85374ea4954878a9d464a70def9f67d9579e746023622d9de7dde57.jpg)  \nFig. 12.4\n\nIf we consider the surface of the newly formed object, we would be able to see only the curved surfaces of the two hemispheres and the curved surface of the cylinder.\n\nSo, the total surface area of the new solid is the sum of the curved surface areas of each of the individual parts. This gives,\n\nTSA of new solid $=$ CSA of one hemisphere $^ +$ CSA of cylinder\n\n$+ \\mathrm { C S A }$ of other hemisphere\n\nwhere TSA, CSA stand for ‘Total Surface Area’ and ‘Curved Surface Area’ respectively.\n\nLet us now consider another situation. Suppose we are making a toy by putting together a hemisphere and a cone. Let us see the steps that we would be going through.\n\nFirst, we would take a cone and a hemisphere and bring their flat faces together. Here, of course, we would take the base radius of the cone equal to the radius of the hemisphere, for the toy is to have a smooth surface. So, the steps would be as shown in Fig. 12.5.\n\n![](images/a3c361508da5e815989be6a35b42750389ef67c3bfe19cfafbff9ebe659f8ceb.jpg)  \nFig. 12.5\n\nAt the end of our trial, we have got ourselves a nice round-bottomed toy. Now if we want to find how much paint we would require to colour the surface of this toy, what would we need to know? We would need to know the surface area of the toy, which consists of the CSA of the hemisphere and the CSA of the cone.\n\nSo, we can say:\n\nTotal surface area of the toy $=$ CSA of hemisphere $^ +$ CSA of cone\n\nNow, let us consider some examples.\n\nExample 1 : Rasheed got a playing top (lattu) as his birthday present, which surprisingly had no colour on it. He wanted to colour it with his crayons. The top is shaped like a cone surmounted by a hemisphere (see Fig 12.6). The entire top is 5 cm in height and the diameter of the top is 3.5 cm. Find the area he has to colour.\n\n$$\n\\left(\\text {T a k e} \\pi = \\frac {2 2}{7}\\right)\n$$\n\n![](images/3d94cd5c1f6616b4fe9e07edd7193affac27cac952af87b76d85ba70d924a120.jpg)  \nFig. 12.6\n\nSolution : This top is exactly like the object we have discussed in Fig. 12.5. So, we can conveniently use the result we have arrived at there. That is :\n\nTSA of the toy $=$ CSA of hemisphere $^ +$ CSA of cone\n\nNow, the curved surface area of the hemisphere $=$ 1 2 2 (4 ) 2S S r r",

    "text": "In the previous section, we have discussed how to find the surface area of solids made up of a combination of two basic solids. Here, we shall see how to calculate their volumes. It may be noted that in calculating the surface area, we have not added the surface areas of the two constituents, because some part of the surface area disappeared in the process of joining them. However, this will not be the case when we calculate the volume. The volume of the solid formed by joining two basic solids will actually be the sum of the volumes of the constituents, as we see in the examples below.\n\nExample 5 : Shanta runs an industry in a shed which is in the shape of a cuboid surmounted by a half cylinder (see Fig. 12.12). If the base of the shed is of dimension $7 \\mathrm { m } \\times 1 5 \\mathrm { m }$ , and the height of the cuboidal portion is $8 ~ \\mathrm { m } .$ , find the volume of air that the shed can hold. Further, suppose the machinery in the shed occupies a total space of $3 0 0 \\mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ , and there are 20 workers, each of whom occupy about $0 . 0 8 { \\mathrm { m } } ^ { 3 }$ space on an average.

You have also learnt to represent the data pictorially in the form of various graphs such as bar graphs, histograms (including those of varying widths) and frequency polygons. In fact, you went a step further by studying certain numerical representatives of the ungrouped data, also called measures of central tendency, namely, mean, median and mode. In this chapter, we shall extend the study of these three measures, i.e., mean, median and mode from ungrouped data to that of grouped data. We shall also discuss the concept of cumulative frequency, the cumulative frequency distribution and how to draw cumulative frequency curves, called ogives.",

    "text": "The mean (or average) of observations, as we know, is the sum of the values of all the observations divided by the total number of observations. From Class IX, recall that if $x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } , . . . , x _ { \\mathrm { { n } } }$ are observations with respective frequencies $f _ { 1 } , f _ { 2 } , . . . . f _ { \\mathrm n } ,$ then this means observation $x _ { 1 }$ occurs $f _ { 1 }$ times, $x _ { 2 }$ occurs $f _ { 2 }$ times, and so on.\n\nNow, the sum of the values of all the observations $= f _ { 1 } x _ { 1 } + f _ { 2 } x _ { 2 } + \\ldots + f _ { n } x _ { n } ,$ and the number of observations $= f _ { 1 } + f _ { 2 } + \\ldots + f _ { n } .$ .\n\nSo, the mean $\\overline { { x } }$ of the data is given by\n\n$$\n\\bar {x} = \\frac {f _ {1} x _ {1} + f _ {2} x _ {2} + \\cdots + f _ {n} x _ {n}}{f _ {1} + f _ {2} + \\cdots + f _ {n}}\n$$\n\nRecall that we can write this in short form by using the Greek letter $\\Sigma$ (capital sigma) which means summation. That is,\n\n$$\n\\overline {{x}} = \\frac {\\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} f _ {i} x _ {i}}{\\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} f _ {i}}\n$$\n\nwhich, more briefly, is written as ${ \\overline { { x } } } = { \\frac { \\Sigma f _ { i } x _ { i } } { \\Sigma f _ { i } } }$ , if it is understood that i varies from 1 to $n$ Let us apply this formula to find the mean in the following example.\n\nExample 1 : The marks obtained by 30 students of Class X of a certain school in a Mathematics paper consisting of 100 marks are presented in table below.

So, let us put them in a column as shown in Table 13.1.\n\nTable 13.1   \n\n<table><tr><td>Marks obtained (xi)</td><td>Number of students (fi)</td><td>fixi</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>1</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td>3</td><td>108</td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>4</td><td>160</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>3</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>56</td><td>2</td><td>112</td></tr><tr><td>60</td><td>4</td><td>240</td></tr><tr><td>70</td><td>4</td><td>280</td></tr><tr><td>72</td><td>1</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>80</td><td>1</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>88</td><td>2</td><td>176</td></tr><tr><td>92</td><td>3</td><td>276</td></tr><tr><td>95</td><td>1</td><td>95</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>Σfi=30</td><td>Σf.xi=1779</td></tr></table>\n\nNow, 6 i if xx 1779 ${ \\overline { { x } } } = { \\frac { \\Sigma f _ { i } x _ { i } } { \\Sigma f _ { i } } } = { \\frac { 1 7 7 9 } { 3 0 } } = 5 9 . 3$",

    "text": "Therefore, the mean marks obtained is 59.3.\n\nIn most of our real life situations, data is usually so large that to make a meaningful study it needs to be condensed as grouped data. So, we need to convert given ungrouped data into grouped data and devise some method to find its mean.\n\nLet us convert the ungrouped data of Example 1 into grouped data by forming class-intervals of width, say 15. Remember that, while allocating frequencies to each class-interval, students falling in any upper class-limit would be considered in the next class, e.g., 4 students who have obtained 40 marks would be considered in the class-interval 40-55 and not in 25-40. With this convention in our mind, let us form a grouped frequency distribution table (see Table 13.2).\n\nTable 13.2   \n\n<table><tr><td>Class interval</td><td>10 - 25</td><td>25 - 40</td><td>40 - 55</td><td>55 - 70</td><td>70 - 85</td><td>85 - 100</td></tr><tr><td>Number of students</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr></table>\n\nNow, for each class-interval, we require a point which would serve as the representative of the whole class. It is assumed that the frequency of each class-interval is centred around its mid-point. So the mid-point (or class mark) of each class can be chosen to represent the observations falling in the class. Recall that we find the mid-point of a class (or its class mark) by finding the average of its upper and lower limits. That is,\n\n$$\n\\text {C l a s s m a r k} = \\frac {\\text {U p p e r c l a s s l i m i t} + \\text {L o w e r c l a s s l i m i t}}{2}\n$$\n\nWith reference to Table 13.2, for the class 10-25, the class mark is $\\frac { 1 0 + 2 5 } { 2 }$ ， , i.e., 17.5. Similarly, we can find the class marks of the remaining class intervals. We put them in Table 13.3. These class marks serve as our $x _ { \\ i } ^ { \\ i }$ ’s. Now, in general, for the ith class interval, we have the frequency $f _ { i }$ corresponding to the class mark $x _ { i }$ . We can now proceed to compute the mean in the same manner as in Example 1.\n\nTable 13.3   \n\n<table><tr><td>Class interval</td><td>Number of students (fi)</td><td>Class mark (xi)</td><td>fi xi</td></tr><tr><td>10 - 25</td><td>2</td><td>17.5</td><td>35.0</td></tr><tr><td>25 - 40</td><td>3</td><td>32.5</td><td>97.5</td></tr><tr><td>40 - 55</td><td>7</td><td>47.5</td><td>332.5</td></tr><tr><td>55 - 70</td><td>6</td><td>62.5</td><td>375.0</td></tr><tr><td>70 - 85</td><td>6</td><td>77.5</td><td>465.0</td></tr><tr><td>85 - 100</td><td>6</td><td>92.5</td><td>555.0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>Σ fi = 30</td><td></td><td>Σ fi xi = 1860.0</td></tr></table>\n\nThe sum of the values in the last column gives us $\\Sigma f _ { i } x _ { i }$ . So, the mean $\\overline { { x } }$ of the given data is given by\n\n$$\n\\bar {x} = \\frac {\\sum f _ {i} x _ {i}}{\\sum f _ {i}} = \\frac {1 8 6 0 . 0}{3 0} = 6 2\n$$\n\nThis new method of finding the mean is known as the Direct Method.",

    "text": "We observe that Tables 13.1 and 13.3 are using the same data and employing the same formula for the calculation of the mean but the results obtained are different. Can you think why this is so, and which one is more accurate? The difference in the two values is because of the mid-point assumption in Table 13.3, 59.3 being the exact mean, while 62 an approximate mean.\n\nSometimes when the numerical values of $x _ { i }$ and $f _ { i }$ are large, finding the product of $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } } _ { i }$ and f becomes tedious and time consuming. So, for such situations, let us think of a method of reducing these calculations.\n\nWe can do nothing with the $f _ { i } ^ { \\phantom { } ^ { \\dagger } } \\mathbf { S } _ { \\mathrm { i } }$ , but we can change each $x _ { i }$ to a smaller number so that our calculations become easy. How do we do this? What about subtracting a fixed number from each of these $x _ { \\ i } ^ { \\phantom { } } \\mathrm { s } _ { \\mathrm { } } ^ { \\dagger }$ Let us try this method.\n\nThe first step is to choose one among the $x _ { i } ^ { \\mathrm { ' } } \\mathbf { S }$ as the assumed mean, and denote it by $ { { ^ \\circ } } a ^ { \\prime }$ . Also, to further reduce our calculation work, we may take $ { { ^ \\circ } } _ { a } .$ to be that $x _ { i }$ which lies in the centre of $x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } , . . . . , x _ { n }$ . So, we can choose $a = 4 7 . 5$ or $a = 6 2 . 5$ . Let us choose $a = 4 7 . 5$ .\n\nThe next step is to find the difference $d _ { i }$ between $a$ and each of the x ’s, that is, the deviation of $ { { ^ \\circ } } a ^ { \\prime }$ from each of the $x _ { _ i }$ ’s.\n\ni.e., $d _ { i } = x _ { i } - a = x _ { i } - 4 7 . 5$\n\nThe third step is to find the product of $d _ { i }$ with the corresponding $f _ { i } ,$ and take the sum of all the $f _ { i }$ $d _ { i }$ ’s. The calculations are shown in Table 13.4.\n\nTable 13.4   \n\n<table><tr><td>Class interval</td><td>Number of students (fi)</td><td>Class mark (xi)</td><td>di = xi - 47.5</td><td>fdi</td></tr><tr><td>10 - 25</td><td>2</td><td>17.5</td><td>-30</td><td>-60</td></tr><tr><td>25 - 40</td><td>3</td><td>32.5</td><td>-15</td><td>-45</td></tr><tr><td>40 - 55</td><td>7</td><td>47.5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>55 - 70</td><td>6</td><td>62.5</td><td>15</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>70 - 85</td><td>6</td><td>77.5</td><td>30</td><td>180</td></tr><tr><td>85 - 100</td><td>6</td><td>92.5</td><td>45</td><td>270</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>Σfi = 30</td><td></td><td></td><td>Σfdi = 435</td></tr></table>",

So the choice of method to be used depends on the numerical values of $x _ { i }$ and $f _ { i } .$ If $x _ { i }$ and $f _ { i }$ are sufficiently small, then the direct method is an appropriate choice.

    "text": "Recall from Class IX, a mode is that value among the observations which occurs most often, that is, the value of the observation having the maximum frequency. Further, we discussed finding the mode of ungrouped data. Here, we shall discuss ways of obtaining a mode of grouped data. It is possible that more than one value may have the same maximum frequency. In such situations, the data is said to be multimodal. Though grouped data can also be multimodal, we shall restrict ourselves to problems having a single mode only.\n\nLet us first recall how we found the mode for ungrouped data through the following example.\n\nExample 4 : The wickets taken by a bowler in 10 cricket matches are as follows:\n\n2 6 4 5 0 2 1 3 2 3\n\nFind the mode of the data.\n\nSolution : Let us form the frequency distribution table of the given data as follows:\n\n<table><tr><td>Number of \nwickets</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Number of \nmatches</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr></table>\n\nClearly, 2 is the number of wickets taken by the bowler in the maximum number (i.e., 3) of matches. So, the mode of this data is 2.\n\nIn a grouped frequency distribution, it is not possible to determine the mode by looking at the frequencies. Here, we can only locate a class with the maximum frequency, called the modal class. The mode is a value inside the modal class, and is given by the formula:\n\n$$\n\\text {M o d e} = l + \\left(\\frac {f _ {1} - f _ {0}}{2 f _ {1} - f _ {0} - f _ {2}}\\right) \\times h\n$$\n\nwhere $l =$ lower limit of the modal class,\n\n$$\nh = \\text {s i z e o f t h e c l a s s i n t e r v a l (a s s u m i n g a l l c l a s s s i z e s t o b e e q u a l)},\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l} f _ {1} = \\text {f r e q u e n c y o f t h e m o d a l c l a s s}, \\\\ f _ {0} = \\text {f r e q u e n c y o f t h e c l a s s p r e c e d i n g t h e m o d a l c l a s s}, \\\\ f _ {2} = \\mathrm {f r e q u e n c y o f t h e c l a s s s u c e e d i n g t h e m o d a l c l a s s}. \\\\ \\end{array}\n$$\n\nLet us consider the following examples to illustrate the use of this formula.\n\nExample ${ \\boldsymbol { 5 } } :$ A survey conducted on 20 households in a locality by a group of students resulted in the following frequency table for the number of family members in a household:",

Since the maximum number of students (i.e., 7) have got marks in the interval 40 - 55, the modal class is 40 - 55.

    "text": "As you have studied in Class IX, the median is a measure of central tendency which gives the value of the middle-most observation in the data. Recall that for finding the median of ungrouped data, we first arrange the data values of the observations in ascending order. Then, if n is odd, the median is the $\\left( { \\frac { n + 1 } { 2 } } \\right)$ th observation. And, if $n$ is even, then the median will be the average of the $\\frac { n } { 2 }$ th and the $\\left( { \\frac { n } { 2 } } + 1 \\right)$ th observations.\n\nSuppose, we have to find the median of the following data, which gives the marks, out of 50, obtained by 100 students in a test :\n\n<table><tr><td>Marks obtained</td><td>20</td><td>29</td><td>28</td><td>33</td><td>42</td><td>38</td><td>43</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Number of students</td><td>6</td><td>28</td><td>24</td><td>15</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>20</td></tr></table>\n\nFirst, we arrange the marks in ascending order and prepare a frequency table as follows :\n\nTable 13.9   \n\n<table><tr><td>Marks obtained</td><td>Number of students\n(Frequency)</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>42</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>43</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>100</td></tr></table>\n\nHere $n = 1 0 0$ , which is even. The median will be the average of the $\\frac { n } { 2 }$ th and the $\\left( { \\frac { n } { 2 } } + 1 \\right)$ th observations, i.e., the 50th and 51st observations. To find these observations, we proceed as follows:\n\nTable 13.10   \n\n<table><tr><td>Marks obtained</td><td>Number of students</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>upto 25</td><td>6 + 20 = 26</td></tr><tr><td>upto 28</td><td>26 + 24 = 50</td></tr><tr><td>upto 29</td><td>50 + 28 = 78</td></tr><tr><td>upto 33</td><td>78 + 15 = 93</td></tr><tr><td>upto 38</td><td>93 + 4 = 97</td></tr><tr><td>upto 42</td><td>97 + 2 = 99</td></tr><tr><td>upto 43</td><td>99 + 1 = 100</td></tr></table>\n\nNow we add another column depicting this information to the frequency table above and name it as cumulative frequency column.\n\nTable 13.11   \n\n<table><tr><td>Marks obtained</td><td>Number of students</td><td>Cumulative frequency</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>20</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>24</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>28</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>15</td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td>4</td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>42</td><td>2</td><td>99</td></tr><tr><td>43</td><td>1</td><td>100</td></tr></table>\n\nFrom the table above, we see that:\n\n$$\n5 0 \\mathrm {t h} \\quad \\text {o b s e r v a t o n i s} 2 8 \\quad (\\mathrm {W h y ?})\n$$\n\n$$\n5 1 \\mathrm {s t}\n$$\n\nSo, $\\mathrm { M e d i a n } = { \\frac { 2 8 + 2 9 } { 2 } } = 2 8 . 5$\n\nRemark : The part of Table 13.11 consisting Column 1 and Column 3 is known as Cumulative Frequency Table. The median marks 28.5 conveys the information that about $50 \\%$ students obtained marks less than 28.5 and another $50 \\%$ students obtained marks more than 28.5.\n\nNow, let us see how to obtain the median of grouped data, through the following situation.\n\nConsider a grouped frequency distribution of marks obtained, out of 100, by 53 students, in a certain examination, as follows:\n\nTable 13.12   \n\n<table><tr><td>Marks</td><td>Number of students</td></tr><tr><td>0 - 10</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>10 - 20</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>20 - 30</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>30 - 40</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>40 - 50</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>50 - 60</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>60 - 70</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>70 - 80</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>80 - 90</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>90 - 100</td><td>8</td></tr></table>\n\nFrom the table above, try to answer the following questions:\n\nHow many students have scored marks less than 10?

    "text": "How many students have scored less than 20 marks? Observe that the number of students who have scored less than 20 include the number of students who have scored marks from 0 - 10 as well as the number of students who have scored marks from 10 - 20. So, the total number of students with marks less than 20 is $5 + 3$ , i.e., 8. We say that the cumulative frequency of the class 10 -20 is 8.\n\nSimilarly, we can compute the cumulative frequencies of the other classes, i.e., the number of students with marks less than 30, less than 40, . . ., less than 100. We give them in Table 13.13 given below:\n\nTable 13.13   \n\n<table><tr><td>Marks obtained</td><td>Number of students\n(Cumulative frequency)</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 10</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 20</td><td>5 + 3 = 8</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 30</td><td>8 + 4 = 12</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 40</td><td>12 + 3 = 15</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 50</td><td>15 + 3 = 18</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 60</td><td>18 + 4 = 22</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 70</td><td>22 + 7 = 29</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 80</td><td>29 + 9 = 38</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 90</td><td>38 + 7 = 45</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 100</td><td>45 + 8 = 53</td></tr></table>\n\nThe distribution given above is called the cumulative frequency distribution of the less than type. Here 10, 20, 30, . . . 100, are the upper limits of the respective class intervals.\n\nWe can similarly make the table for the number of students with scores, more than or equal to 0, more than or equal to 10, more than or equal to 20, and so on. From Table 13.12, we observe that all 53 students have scored marks more than or equal to 0. Since there are 5 students scoring marks in the interval 0 - 10, this means that there are $5 3 - 5 = 4 8$ students getting more than or equal to 10 marks. Continuing in the same manner, we get the number of students scoring 20 or above as $4 8 - 3 = 4 5$ , 30 or above as $4 5 - 4 = 4 1$ , and so on, as shown in Table 13.14.\n\nTable 13.14   \n\n<table><tr><td>Marks obtained</td><td>Number of students\n(Cumulative frequency)</td></tr><tr><td>More than or equal to 0</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>More than or equal to 10</td><td>53 – 5 = 48</td></tr><tr><td>More than or equal to 20</td><td>48 – 3 = 45</td></tr><tr><td>More than or equal to 30</td><td>45 – 4 = 41</td></tr><tr><td>More than or equal to 40</td><td>41 – 3 = 38</td></tr><tr><td>More than or equal to 50</td><td>38 – 3 = 35</td></tr><tr><td>More than or equal to 60</td><td>35 – 4 = 31</td></tr><tr><td>More than or equal to 70</td><td>31 – 7 = 24</td></tr><tr><td>More than or equal to 80</td><td>24 – 9 = 15</td></tr><tr><td>More than or equal to 90</td><td>15 – 7 = 8</td></tr></table>\n\nThe table above is called a cumulative frequency distribution of the more than type.

It is, therefore, necessary to find the value inside a class that divides the whole distribution into two halves. But which class should this be?\n\nTo find this class, we find the cumulative frequencies of all the classes and $\\frac { n } { 2 }$ . We now locate the class whose cumulative frequency is greater than (and nearest to) $\\frac { n } { 2 }$  This is called the median class. In the distribution above, $n = 5 3$ . So, $\\frac { n } { 2 } = 2 6 . 5 . \\mathrm { N o w } 6 0 - 7 0 $ is the class whose cumulative frequency 29 is greater than (and nearest to) $\\frac { n } { 2 }$ , i.e., 26.5.\n\nTherefore, 60 – 70 is the median class.\n\nAfter finding the median class, we use the following formula for calculating the median.\n\n$$\n\\text {M e d i a n} = l + \\left(\\frac {\\frac {n}{2} - \\operatorname {c f}}{f}\\right) \\times h,\n$$\n\nwhere $l =$ lower limit of median class,\n\n$$\nn = \\text {n u m b e r o f o b s e r v a t i o n s},\n$$\n\ncf = cumulative frequency of class preceding the median class,\n\n$f =$ frequency of median class,\n\n$h =$ class size (assuming class size to be equal).\n\nSubstituting the values $\\frac { n } { 2 } = 2 6 . 5$ , l = 60, cf = 22, f = 7, h = 10\n\nin the formula above, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l} \\text {M e d i a n} = 6 0 + \\left(\\frac {2 6 . 5 - 2 2}{7}\\right) \\times 1 0 \\\\ = 6 0 + \\frac {4 5}{7} \\\\ = 6 6. 4 \\\\ \\end{array}\n$$\n\nSo, about half the students have scored marks less than 66.4, and the other half have scored marks more than 66.4.\n\nExample 7 : A survey regarding the heights (in cm) of 51 girls of Class X of a school was conducted and the following data was obtained:\n\n<table><tr><td>Height (in cm)</td><td>Number of girls</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 140</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 145</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 150</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 155</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 160</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 165</td><td>51</td></tr></table>\n\nFind the median height.\n\nSolution : To calculate the median height, we need to find the class intervals and their corresponding frequencies.",

Observe that from the given distribution, we find that there are 4 girls with height less than 140, i.e., the frequency of class interval below 140 is 4. Now, there are 11 girls with heights less than 145 and 4 girls with height less than 140. Therefore, the number of girls with height in the interval 140 - 145 is $1 1 - 4 = 7$ . Similarly, the frequency of 145 - 150 is $2 9 - 1 1 = 1 8$ , for 150 - 155, it is $4 0 - 2 9 = 1 1$ , and so on.

Then,\n\n$l ~ ( \\mathrm { t h e \\ l o w e r \\ l i m i t } ) = 1 4 5 ,$\n\ncf (the cumulative frequency of the class preceding $1 4 5 - 1 5 0 ) = 1 1$ ,\n\n$f$ (the frequency of the median class $1 4 5 - 1 5 0 ) = 1 8 \\phantom { . }$\n\nh (the class size) = 5.\n\nn cf Using the formula, Median l + 2 h  u , we have f\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l} \\text {M e d i a n} = 1 4 5 + \\left(\\frac {2 5 . 5 - 1 1}{1 8}\\right) \\times 5 \\\\ = 1 4 5 + \\frac {7 2 . 5}{1 8} = 1 4 9. 0 3. \\\\ \\end{array}\n$$\n\nSo, the median height of the girls is 149.03 cm.\n\nThis means that the height of about $50 \\%$ of the girls is less than this height, and $50 \\%$ are taller than this height.\n\nExample 8 : The median of the following data is 525.

It also enables us to compare two or more distributions. For example, by comparing the average (mean) results of students of different schools of a particular examination, we can conclude which school has a better performance.\n\nHowever, extreme values in the data affect the mean. For example, the mean of classes having frequencies more or less the same is a good representative of the data. But, if one class has frequency, say 2, and the five others have frequency 20, 25, 20, 21, 18, then the mean will certainly not reflect the way the data behaves. So, in such cases, the mean is not a good representative of the data.\n\nIn problems where individual observations are not important, and we wish to find out a ‘typical’ observation, the median is more appropriate, e.g., finding the typical productivity rate of workers, average wage in a country, etc. These are situations where extreme values may be there. So, rather than the mean, we take the median as a better measure of central tendency.",

Woodward\n\n### 14.1 Probability — A Theoretical Approach\n\nLet us consider the following situation :\n\nSuppose a coin is tossed at random.\n\nWhen we speak of a coin, we assume it to be ‘fair’, that is, it is symmetrical so that there is no reason for it to come down more often on one side than the other. We call this property of the coin as being ‘unbiased’. By the phrase ‘random toss’, we mean that the coin is allowed to fall freely without any bias or interference.\n\nWe know, in advance, that the coin can only land in one of two possible ways — either head up or tail up (we dismiss the possibility of its ‘landing’ on its edge, which may be possible, for example, if it falls on sand). We can reasonably assume that each outcome, head or tail, is as likely to occur as the other. We refer to this by saying that the outcomes head and tail, are equally likely.\n\nFor another example of equally likely outcomes, suppose we throw a die once. For us, a die will always mean a fair die. What are the possible outcomes? They are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Each number has the same possibility of showing up. So the equally likely outcomes of throwing a die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.\n\nAre the outcomes of every experiment equally likely? Let us see.\n\nSuppose that a bag contains 4 red balls and 1 blue ball, and you draw a ball without looking into the bag. What are the outcomes? Are the outcomes — a red ball and a blue ball equally likely? Since there are 4 red balls and only one blue ball, you would agree that you are more likely to get a red ball than a blue ball. So, the outcomes (a red ball or a blue ball) are not equally likely. However, the outcome of drawing a ball of any colour from the bag is equally likely. So, all experiments do not necessarily have equally likely outcomes.\n\nHowever, in this chapter, from now on, we will assume that all the experiments have equally likely outcomes.\n\nIn Class IX, we defined the experimental or empirical probability P(E) of an event E as\n\n$$\n\\mathrm {P} (\\mathrm {E}) = \\frac {\\text {N u m b e r o f t r i a l s i n w h i c h t h e e v e n t h a p p e n e d}}{\\text {T o t a l n u m b e r o f t r i a l s}}\n$$",

    "text": "The empirical interpretation of probability can be applied to every event associated with an experiment which can be repeated a large number of times. The requirement of repeating an experiment has some limitations, as it may be very expensive or unfeasible in many situations. Of course, it worked well in coin tossing or die throwing experiments. But how about repeating the experiment of launching a satellite in order to compute the empirical probability of its failure during launching, or the repetition of the phenomenon of an earthquake to compute the empirical probability of a multi-storeyed building getting destroyed in an earthquake?\n\nIn experiments where we are prepared to make certain assumptions, the repetition of an experiment can be avoided, as the assumptions help in directly calculating the exact (theoretical) probability. The assumption of equally likely outcomes (which is valid in many experiments, as in the two examples above, of a coin and of a die) is one such assumption that leads us to the following definition of probability of an event.\n\nThe theoretical probability (also called classical probability) of an event E, written as P(E), is defined as\n\n$$\n\\mathbf {P} (\\mathbf {E}) = \\frac {\\text {N u m b e r o f o u t c o m e s f a v o u r a b l e t o E}}{\\text {N u m b e r o f a l l p o s s i b l e o u t c o m e s o f t h e e x p e r i m e n t}},\n$$\n\nwhere we assume that the outcomes of the experiment are equally likely.\n\nWe will briefly refer to theoretical probability as probability.\n\nThis definition of probability was given by Pierre Simon Laplace in 1795.\n\nProbability theory had its origin in the 16th century when an Italian physician and mathematician J.Cardan wrote the first book on the subject, The Book on Games of Chance. Since its inception, the study of probability has attracted the attention of great mathematicians. James Bernoulli (1654 – 1705), A. de Moivre (1667 – 1754), and Pierre Simon Laplace are among those who made significant contributions to this field. Laplace’s Theorie Analytique des Probabilités, 1812, is considered to be the greatest contribution by a single person to the theory of probability. In recent years, probability has been used extensively in many areas such as biology, economics, genetics, physics, sociology etc.\n\n![](images/8bd2b8768523963cfaea7ce265e8d6189c7dc5cf63d97351b0890b0028b6e47a.jpg)  \nPierre Simon Laplace (1749 – 1827)\n\nLet us find the probability for some of the events associated with experiments where the equally likely assumption holds.\n\nExample $1 :$ Find the probability of getting a head when a coin is tossed once. Also find the probability of getting a tail.\n\nSolution : In the experiment of tossing a coin once, the number of possible outcomes is two — Head (H) and Tail (T). Let E be the event ‘getting a head’. The number of outcomes favourable to E, (i.e., of getting a head) is 1. Therefore,",

Similarly, in Example 2, all the three events, Y, B and R are elementary events.   \n2. In Example 1, we note that : $: { \\mathrm { P } } ( { \\mathrm { E } } ) + { \\mathrm { P } } ( { \\mathrm { F } } ) = 1$\n\nIn Example 2, we note that $: \\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { Y } ) + \\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { R } ) + \\mathrm { P } ( \\mathrm { B } ) = 1$\n\nObserve that the sum of the probabilities of all the elementary events of an experiment is 1.

    "text": "The outcomes favourable to the event E, ‘at least one head’ are (H, H), (H, T) and (T, H). (Why?)\n\nSo, the number of outcomes favourable to E is 3.\n\nTherefore, $\\mathrm { P ( E ) } = { \\frac { 3 } { 4 } }$\n\ni.e., the probability that Harpreet gets at least one head is $\\frac 3 4$\n\nNote : You can also find P(E) as follows:\n\n$$\nP (E) = 1 - P (\\overline {{E}}) = 1 - \\frac {1}{4} = \\frac {3}{4} \\quad \\left(S i n c e P (\\overline {{E}}) = P (n o h e a d) = \\frac {1}{4}\\right)\n$$\n\nDid you observe that in all the examples discussed so far, the number of possible outcomes in each experiment was finite? If not, check it now.\n\nThere are many experiments in which the outcome is any number between two given numbers, or in which the outcome is every point within a circle or rectangle, etc. Can you now count the number of all possible outcomes? As you know, this is not possible since there are infinitely many numbers between two given numbers, or there are infinitely many points within a circle. So, the definition of (theoretical) probability which you have learnt so far cannot be applied in the present form. What is the way out? To answer this, let us consider the following example :\n\nExample $\\mathbf { 1 0 ^ { * } }$ : In a musical chair game, the person playing the music has been advised to stop playing the music at any time within 2 minutes after she starts playing. What is the probability that the music will stop within the first half-minute after starting?\n\nSolution : Here the possible outcomes are all the numbers between 0 and 2. This is the portion of the number line from 0 to 2 (see Fig. 14.1).\n\n![](images/e9f84f9102cc3fd7f337e2e42e7db1c542cc133e4b5f543675e705e0287fd0f0.jpg)\n\nLet E be the event that ‘the music is stopped within the first half-minute’.\n\nThe outcomes favourable to E are points on the number line from 0 to $\\frac { 1 } { 2 }$ .\n\nThe distance from 0 to 2 is 2, while the distance from 0 to $\\frac { 1 } { 2 }$ is . $\\frac { 1 } { 2 }$\n\nSince all the outcomes are equally likely, we can argue that, of the total distance of 2, the distance favourable to the event E is $\\frac { 1 } { 2 }$ .",

    "text": "z An adult human body contains approximately $1 { , } 5 0 { , } 0 0 0 \\mathrm { k m }$ of arteries and veins that carry blood.   \nz The human heart pumps 5 to 6 litres of blood in the body every 60 seconds.   \nz The temperature at the surface of the Sun is about $6 { , } 0 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$\n\nHave you ever wondered how our scientists and mathematicians could possibly have estimated these results? Did they pull out the veins and arteries from some adult dead bodies and measure them? Did they drain out the blood to arrive at these results? Did they travel to the Sun with a thermometer to get the temperature of the Sun? Surely not. Then how did they get these figures?\n\nWell, the answer lies in mathematical modelling, which we introduced to you in Class IX. Recall that a mathematical model is a mathematical description of some real-life situation. Also, recall that mathematical modelling is the process of creating a mathematical model of a problem, and using it to analyse and solve the problem.\n\nSo, in mathematical modelling, we take a real-world problem and convert it to an equivalent mathematical problem. We then solve the mathematical problem, and interpret its solution in the situation of the real-world problem. And then, it is important to see that the solution, we have obtained, ‘makes sense’, which is the stage of validating the model. Some examples, where mathematical modelling is of great importance, are:\n\n(i) Finding the width and depth of a river at an unreachable place.   \n(ii) Estimating the mass of the Earth and other planets.   \n(iii) Estimating the distance between Earth and any other planet.   \n(iv) Predicting the arrrival of the monsoon in a country.\n\n(v) Predicting the trend of the stock market.   \n(vi) Estimating the volume of blood inside the body of a person.   \n(vii) Predicting the population of a city after 10 years.   \n(viii) Estimating the number of leaves in a tree.   \n(ix) Estimating the ppm of different pollutants in the atmosphere of a city.   \n(x) Estimating the effect of pollutants on the environment.   \n(xi) Estimating the temperature on the Sun’s surface.\n\nIn this chapter we shall revisit the process of mathematical modelling, and take examples from the world around us to illustrate this. In Section A2.2 we take you through all the stages of building a model. In Section A2.3, we discuss a variety of examples. In Section A2.4, we look at reasons for the importance of mathematical modelling.\n\nA point to remember is that here we aim to make you aware of an important way in which mathematics helps to solve real-world problems. However, you need to know some more mathematics to really appreciate the power of mathematical modelling. In higher classes some examples giving this flavour will be found.",

    "text": "In Class IX, we considered some examples of the use of modelling. Did they give you an insight into the process and the steps involved in it? Let us quickly revisit the main steps in mathematical modelling.\n\nStep 1 (Understanding the problem) : Define the real problem, and if working in a team, discuss the issues that you wish to understand. Simplify by making assumptions and ignoring certain factors so that the problem is manageable.\n\nFor example, suppose our problem is to estimate the number of fishes in a lake. It is not possible to capture each of these fishes and count them. We could possibly capture a sample and from it try and estimate the total number of fishes in the lake.\n\nStep 2 (Mathematical description and formulation) : Describe, in mathematical terms, the different aspects of the problem. Some ways to describe the features mathematically, include:\n\nz define variables   \n$\\bullet$ write equations or inequalities   \n$\\bullet$ gather data and organise into tables   \n$\\bullet$ z make graphs   \ncalculate probabilities\n\nFor example, having taken a sample, as stated in Step 1, how do we estimate the entire population? We would have to then mark the sampled fishes, allow them to mix with the remaining ones in the lake, again draw a sample from the lake, and see how many of the previously marked ones are present in the new sample. Then, using ratio and proportion, we can come up with an estimate of the total population. For instance, let us take a sample of 20 fishes from the lake and mark them, and then release them in the same lake, so as to mix with the remaining fishes. We then take another sample (say 50), from the mixed population and see how many are marked. So, we gather our data and analyse it.\n\nOne major assumption we are making is that the marked fishes mix uniformly with the remaining fishes, and the sample we take is a good representative of the entire population.\n\nStep 3 (Solving the mathematical problem) : The simplified mathematical problem developed in Step 2 is then solved using various mathematical techniques.\n\nFor instance, suppose in the second sample in the example in Step 2, 5 fishes are marked. So, ${ \\frac { 5 } { 5 0 } } , \\mathrm { i . e . , } { \\frac { 1 } { 1 0 } } ,$ $\\frac { 5 } { 5 0 } { ; }$ , i.e., ${ \\frac { 1 } { 1 0 } } ,$ of the population is marked. If this is typical of the whole population, then $\\frac { 1 } { 1 0 }$ th of the population $= 2 0$ .\n\nSo, the whole population $= 2 0 \\times 1 0 = 2 0 0$ .\n\nStep 4 (Interpreting the solution) : The solution obtained in the previous step is now looked at, in the context of the real-life situation that we had started with in Step 1.",

    "text": "For instance, our solution in the problem in Step 3 gives us the population of fishes as 200.\n\nStep 5 (Validating the model) : We go back to the original situation and see if the results of the mathematical work make sense. If so, we use the model until new information becomes available or assumptions change.\n\nSometimes, because of the simplification assumptions we make, we may lose essential aspects of the real problem while giving its mathematical description. In such cases, the solution could very often be off the mark, and not make sense in the real situation. If this happens, we reconsider the assumptions made in Step 1 and revise them to be more realistic, possibly by including some factors which were not considered earlier.\n\nFor instance, in Step 3 we had obtained an estimate of the entire population of fishes. It may not be the actual number of fishes in the pond. We next see whether this is a good estimate of the population by repeating Steps 2 and 3 a few times, and taking the mean of the results obtained. This would give a closer estimate of the population.\n\nAnother way of visualising the process of mathematical modelling is shown in Fig. A2.1.\n\n![](images/dd93ea0bbc4970b77c3e6ab37175803abb98342434d699d88f34cc81cf19b680.jpg)  \nFig. A2.1\n\nModellers look for a balance between simplification (for ease of solution) and accuracy. They hope to approximate reality closely enough to make some progress. The best outcome is to be able to predict what will happen, or estimate an outcome, with reasonable accuracy. Remember that different assumptions we use for simplifying the problem can lead to different models. So, there are no perfect models. There are good ones and yet better ones.",

    "text": "Sometimes a trader introduces an instalment scheme as a marketing strategy to allure customers to purchase these articles. Under the instalment scheme, the customer is not required to make full payment of the article at the time of buying it. She/he is allowed to pay a part of it at the time of purchase, and the rest can be paid in instalments, which could be monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or even yearly. Of course, the buyer will have to pay more in the instalment plan, because the seller is going to charge some interest on account of the payment made at a later date (called deferred payment).\n\nBefore we take a few examples to understand the instalment scheme, let us understand the most frequently used terms related to this concept.\n\nThe cash price of an article is the amount which a customer has to pay as full payment of the article at the time it is purchased. Cash down payment is the amount which a customer has to pay as part payment of the price of an article at the time of purchase.\n\nRemark : If the instalment scheme is such that the remaining payment is completely made within one year of the purchase of the article, then simple interest is charged on the deferred payment.\n\nIn the past, charging interest on borrowed money was often considered evil, and, in particular, was long prohibited. One way people got around the law against paying interest was to borrow in one currency and repay in another, the interest being disguised in the exchange rate.\n\nLet us now come to a related mathematical modelling problem.\n\nExample 2 : Juhi wants to buy a bicycle. She goes to the market and finds that the bicycle she likes is available for ` 1800. Juhi has ` 600 with her. So, she tells the shopkeeper that she would not be able to buy it. The shopkeeper, after a bit of calculation, makes the following offer. He tells Juhi that she could take the bicycle by making a payment of ` 600 cash down and the remaining money could be made in two monthly instalments of ` 610 each. Juhi has two options one is to go for instalment scheme or to make cash payment by taking loan from a bank which is available at the rate of $10 \\%$ per annum simple interest.

An ornithologist wants to estimate the number of parrots in a large field. She uses a net to catch some, and catches 32 parrots, which she rings and sets free. The following week she manages to net 40 parrots, of which 8 are ringed.\n\n(i) What fraction of her second catch is ringed?\n\n(ii) Find an estimate of the total number of parrots in the field.\n\n2. Suppose the adjoining figure represents an aerial photograph of a forest with each dot representing a tree. Your purpose is to find the number of trees there are on this tract of land as part of an environmental census.\n\n![](images/84d2ee951294e2a6ba832f531be59ada524725e4b6e24736a4b7e91a465461fa.jpg)\n\n3.

    "text": "As we have seen in the examples, mathematical modelling is an interdisciplinary subject. Mathematicians and specialists in other fields share their knowledge and expertise to improve existing products, develop better ones, or predict the behaviour of certain products.\n\nThere are, of course, many specific reasons for the importance of modelling, but most are related in some ways to the following :\n\nz To gain understanding. If we have a mathematical model which reflects the essential behaviour of a real-world system of interest, we can understand that system better through an analysis of the model. Furthermore, in the process of building the model we find out which factors are most important in the system, and how the different aspects of the system are related.   \nz To predict, or forecast, or simulate. Very often, we wish to know what a real-world system will do in the future, but it is expensive, impractical or impossible to experiment directly with the system. For example, in weather prediction, to study drug efficacy in humans, finding an optimum design of a nuclear reactor, and so on.\n\nForecasting is very important in many types of organisations, since predictions of future events have to be incorporated into the decision-making process. For example:\n\nIn marketing departments, reliable forecasts of demand help in planning of the sale strategies.\n\nA school board needs to able to forecast the increase in the number of school going children in various districts so as to decide where and when to start new schools.\n\nMost often, forecasters use the past data to predict the future. They first analyse the data in order to identify a pattern that can describe it. Then this data and pattern is extended into the future in order to prepare a forecast. This basic strategy is employed in most forecasting techniques, and is based on the assumption that the pattern that has been identified will continue in the future also.\n\nz To estimate. Often, we need to estimate large values. You’ve seen examples of the trees in a forest, fish in a lake, etc. For another example, before elections, the contesting parties want to predict the probability of their party winning the elections. In particular, they want to estimate how many people in their constituency would vote for their party. Based on their predictions, they may want to decide on the campaign strategy. Exit polls have been used widely to predict the number of seats, a party is expected to get in elections.",

    "text": "Activity 1.1 can be described as – when a magnesium ribbon is burnt in oxygen, it gets converted to magnesium oxide. This description of a chemical reaction in a sentence form is quite long. It can be written in a shorter form. The simplest way to do this is to write it in the form of a word-equation.\n\nThe word-equation for the above reaction would be –\n\nMagnesium + Oxygen®Magnesium oxide\n\n(Reactants) (Product) (1.1)\n\nThe substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction (1.1), magnesium and oxygen, are the reactants. The new substance is magnesium oxide, formed during the reaction, as a product. A word-equation shows change of reactants to products through an arrow placed between them. The reactants are written on the left-hand side (LHS) with a plus sign $( + )$ between them. Similarly, products are written on the right-hand side (RHS) with a plus sign $( + )$ between them. The arrowhead points towards the products, and shows the direction of the reaction.\n\n#### 1.1.1 Writing a Chemical Equation\n\nIs there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations? Chemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use chemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a chemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and magnesium oxide, the above wordequation can be written as –\n\n$$\n\\mathrm {M g} + \\mathrm {O} _ {2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm {M g O} \\tag {1.2}\n$$\n\nCount and compare the number of atoms of each element on the LHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the same on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced. If not, then the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on both sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal chemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical equation for the burning of magnesium in air.\n\n#### 1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations\n\nRecall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the total mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction has to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.\n\nIn other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the same, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a skeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us learn about balancing a chemical equation step by step.\n\nThe word-equation for Activity 1.3 may be represented as –\n\nZinc $^ +$ Sulphuric acid Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen\n\nThe above word-equation may be represented by the following chemical equation –\n\n$$\n\\mathrm {Z n} + \\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\mathrm {S O} _ {4} \\rightarrow \\mathrm {Z n S O} _ {4} + \\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\tag {1.3}\n$$\n\nLet us examine the number of atoms of different elements on both sides of the arrow.",

(1.3) is a balanced chemical equation.\n\nLet us try to balance the following chemical equation –\n\n$$\n\\mathrm {F e} + \\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} \\rightarrow \\mathrm {F e} _ {3} \\mathrm {O} _ {4} + \\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\tag {1.4}\n$$\n\nStep I: To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each formula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the equation.\n\n$$\n\\boxed {\\mathrm {F e}} + \\boxed {\\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O}} \\rightarrow \\boxed {\\mathrm {F e} _ {3} \\mathrm {O} _ {4}} + \\boxed {\\mathrm {H} _ {2}} \\tag {1.5}\n$$\n\nStep II: List the number of atoms of different elements present in the unbalanced equation (1.5).\n\n<table><tr><td>Element</td><td>Number of atoms in reactants (LHS)</td><td>Number of atoms in products (RHS)</td></tr><tr><td>Fe</td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>H</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>O</td><td>1</td><td>4</td></tr></table>\n\nStep III: It is often convenient to start balancing with the compound that contains the maximum number of atoms. It may be a reactant or a product. In that compound, select the element which has the maximum number of atoms. Using these criteria, we select $\\mathrm { F e } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ and the element oxygen in it. There are four oxygen atoms on the RHS and only one on the LHS.\n\nTo balance the oxygen atoms –\n\n<table><tr><td>Atoms of oxygen</td><td>In reactants</td><td>In products</td></tr><tr><td>(I) Initial</td><td>1 (in H2O)</td><td>4 (in Fe3O4)</td></tr><tr><td>(ii) To balance</td><td>1×4</td><td>4</td></tr></table>\n\nTo equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we cannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the reactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient ‘4’as $4 \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ and\n\nnot $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ or $\\mathrm { ( H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } ) _ { 4 }$ .

Pick any of these elements to proceed further. Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly balanced equation.\n\nTo equalise the number of H atoms, make the number of molecules of hydrogen as four on the RHS.\n\n<table><tr><td>Atoms of oxygen</td><td>In reactants</td><td>In products</td></tr><tr><td>(I) Initial</td><td>8 (in 4H2O)</td><td>4 (in H2)</td></tr><tr><td>(ii) To balance</td><td>8</td><td>2 × 4</td></tr></table>\n\nThe equation would be –\n\n$$\n\\boxed {\\mathrm {F e}} + 4 \\boxed {\\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O}} \\rightarrow \\boxed {\\mathrm {F e} _ {3} \\mathrm {O} _ {4}} + 4 \\boxed {\\mathrm {H} _ {2}} \\tag {1.5}\n$$\n\n(partly balanced equation)",

    "text": "#### 1.3.1 Corrosion\n\nYou must have observed that iron articles are shiny when new, but get coated with a reddish brown powder when left for some time. This process is commonly known as rusting of iron. Some other metals also get tarnished in this manner. Have you noticed the colour of the coating formed on copper and silver? When a metal is attacked by substances around it such as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and this process is called corrosion. The black coating on silver and the green coating on copper are other examples of corrosion.\n\nCorrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges, iron railings, ships and to all objects made of metals, specially those of iron. Corrosion of iron is a serious problem. Every\n\nyear an enormous amount of money is spent to replace damaged iron. You will learn more about corrosion in Chapter 3.\n\n#### 1.3.2 Rancidity\n\nHave you ever tasted or smelt the fat/oil containing food materials left for a long time?\n\nWhen fats and oils are oxidised, they become rancid and their smell and taste change. Usually s u b s t a n c e s w h i c h p r e v e n t o x i d a t i o n (antioxidants) are added to foods containing fats and oil. Keeping food in air tight containers helps to slow down oxidation. Do you know that chips manufacturers usually flush bags of chips with gas such as nitrogen to prevent the chips from getting oxidised ?",

Litmus is a\n\nnatural indicator, turmeric is another such indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth becomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed on it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of water. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and phenolphthalein to test for acids and bases.\n\nIn this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how acids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting things that we use and see in our day-to-day life.",

The electric current is carried through the acidic solution by ions.\n\nAcids contain $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ ion as cation and anion such as $\\mathrm { C l ^ { - } }$ in HCl, $\\mathrm { N O } _ { 3 } ^ { - }$ in $\\mathrm { H N O } _ { 3 }$ , $\\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } ^ { - 2 }$ in $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { S O } _ { 4 }$ , $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { C O O } ^ { - }$ in $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { C O O H }$ . Since the cation present in acids is $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ , this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + } ( \\mathrm { a q } )$ , in solution, which are responsible for their acidic properties.\n\nRepeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity?\n\n#### 2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution?\n\nDo acids produce ions only in aqueous solution? Let us test this.\n\n![](images/c644d13a593b04239065710b75f2be1918dae869e9dfd350aa0b253831ba2ac5.jpg)  \nFigure 2.4 Preparation of HCl gas",

Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric acid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly to water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid, the heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look out for the warning sign (shown in Fig. 2.5) on the can of concentrated sulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets.\n\nMixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the concentration of ions $\\mathrm { ( H , O ^ { + } / O H ^ { - } ) }$ per unit volume.

    "text": "We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between an acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about dilution and decrease in concentration of $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ or $\\mathrm { O H } ^ { - }$ ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is?\n\nWe can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a mixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different colours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.\n\nA scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called pH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German, meaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a number which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher the hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value.\n\nThe pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale represent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it represents an increase in $\\mathrm { O H } ^ { - }$ ion concentration in the solution, that is, increase in the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6). Generally paper impregnated with the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.\n\n![](images/be7d255581298461ce9d86b89f76ca453d62a12bb6c215f5097560ad0fc10dd6.jpg)  \nFigure 2.6 + –Variation of pH with the change in concentration of H (aq) and OH (aq) ions",

Different metals show different reactivities towards oxygen. Metals such as potassium and sodium react so vigorously that they catch fire if kept in the open. Hence, to protect them and to prevent accidental fires, they are kept immersed in kerosene oil. At ordinary temperature, the surfaces of metals such as magnesium, aluminium, zinc, lead, etc., are covered with a thin layer of oxide. The protective oxide layer prevents the metal from further oxidation. Iron does not burn on heating but iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled in the flame of the burner. Copper does not burn, but the hot metal is coated with a black coloured layer of copper(II) oxide. Silver and gold do not react with oxygen even at high temperatures.",

    "text": "Anodising is a process of forming a thick oxide layer of aluminium. Aluminium develops a thin oxide layer when exposed to air. This aluminium oxide coat makes it resistant to further corrosion. The resistance can be improved further by making the oxide layer thicker. During anodising, a clean aluminium article is made the anode and is electrolysed with dilute sulphuric acid. The oxygen gas evolved at the anode reacts with aluminium to make a thicker protective oxide layer. This oxide layer can be dyed easily to give aluminium articles an attractive finish.\n\nAfter performing Activity 3.9, you must have observed that sodium is the most reactive of the samples of metals taken here. The reaction of magnesium is less vigorous implying that it is not as reactive as sodium. But burning in oxygen does not help us to decide about the reactivity of zinc, iron, copper or lead.

    "text": "In the above activities, you saw the reactions of metals with a number of reagents. Why do metals react in this manner? Let us recall what we learnt about the electronic configuration of elements in Class IX. We learnt that noble gases, which have a completely filled valence shell, show little chemical activity. We, therefore, explain the reactivity of elements as a tendency to attain a completely filled valence shell.\n\nLet us have a look at the electronic configuration of noble gases and some metals and non-metals.\n\nWe can see from Table 3.3 that a sodium atom has one electron in its outermost shell. If it loses the electron from its M shell then its L shell now becomes the outermost shell and that has a stable octet. The nucleus of this atom still has 11 protons but the number of electrons has become 10, so there is a net positive charge giving us a sodium cation $\\mathrm { N a + }$ . On the other hand chlorine has seven electrons in its outermost shell and it requires one more\n\nTable 3.3 Electronic configurations of some elements   \n\n<table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Type of element</td><td rowspan=\"2\">Element</td><td rowspan=\"2\">Atomic number</td><td colspan=\"4\">Number of electrons in shells</td></tr><tr><td>K</td><td>L</td><td>M</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">Noble gases</td><td>Helium (He)</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Neon (Ne)</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Argon (Ar)</td><td>18</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"5\">Metals</td><td>Sodium (Na)</td><td>11</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Magnesium (Mg)</td><td>12</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Aluminium (Al)</td><td>13</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Potassium (K)</td><td>19</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Calcium (Ca)</td><td>20</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"6\">Non-metals</td><td>Nitrogen (N)</td><td>7</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Oxygen (O)</td><td>8</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Fluorine (F)</td><td>9</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Phosphorus (P)</td><td>15</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>5</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sulphur (S)</td><td>16</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>6</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Chlorine (Cl)</td><td>17</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td></td></tr></table>\n\nelectron to complete its octet. If sodium and chlorine were to react, the electron lost by sodium could be taken up by chlorine. After gaining an electron, the chlorine atom gets a unit negative charge, because its nucleus has 17 protons and there are 18 electrons in its K, L and M shells. This gives us a chloride anion $\\mathrm { C } 1 ^ { - }$ . So both these elements can have a give-and-take relation between them as follows (Fig. 3.5).\n\n![](images/f37039a59cd32ff015eb74f3752059d7bb63ff315ac1e2455b0a767cb433a854.jpg)  \nFigure 3.5 Formation of sodium chloride\n\nSodium and chloride ions, being oppositely charged, attract each other and are held by strong electrostatic forces of attraction to exist as sodium chloride (NaCl). It should be noted that sodium chloride does not exist as molecules but aggregates of oppositely charged ions.\n\nLet us see the formation of one more ionic compound, magnesium chloride (Fig. 3.6).\n\n![](images/5f60fdb770ecff15fe16ef1f07658887f660ca4f4f960e3e5047d4c7534564ea.jpg)\n\n![](images/55d74e63269aa303a9593854dd0d0366c01c07cea593d912fbb65a064ed2fdaf.jpg)  \nFigure 3.6 Formation of magnesium chloride\n\nThe compounds formed in this manner by the transfer of electrons from a metal to a nonmetal are known as ionic compounds or electrovalent compounds.

A solution of an ionic compound in water contains ions, which move to the opposite electrodes when electricity is passed through the solution. Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conduct electricity because movement of ions in the solid is not possible due to their rigid structure. But ionic compounds conduct electricity in the molten state. This is possible in the molten state since the elecrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions are overcome due to the heat. Thus, the ions move freely and conduct electricity.\n\n## \n\n1.

    "text": "The earth’s crust is the major source of metals. Seawater also contains some soluble salts such as sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, etc. The elements or compounds, which occur naturally in the earth’s crust, are known as minerals. At some places, minerals contain a very high percentage of a particular metal and the metal can be profitably extracted from it. These minerals are called ores.\n\n#### 3.4.1 Extraction of Metals\n\nYou have learnt about the reactivity series of metals. Having this knowledge, you can easily understand how a metal is extracted from its ore. Some metals are found in the earth’s crust in the free state. Some are found in the form of their compounds. The metals at the bottom of the activity series are the least reactive. They are often found in a free state. For example, gold, silver, platinum and copper are found in the free state. Copper and silver are also found in the combined state as their sulphide or oxide ores. The metals at the top of the activity series (K, Na, Ca, Mg and Al) are so reactive that they are never found in nature as free elements.\n\n![](images/09c9fd18fe71c33836f4407c72e9470e9e7acbffb0fafc850921ce9fe2ca06c6.jpg)  \nFigure 3.9 Activity series and related metallurgy\n\nThe metals in the middle of the activity series (Zn, Fe, Pb, etc.) are moderately reactive. They are found in the earth’s crust mainly as oxides, sulphides or carbonates. You will find that the ores of many metals are oxides. This is because oxygen is a very reactive element and is very abundant on the earth.\n\nThus on the basis of reactivity, we can group the metals into the following three categories (Fig. 3.9) – (i) Metals of low reactivity; (ii) Metals of medium reactivity; (iii) Metals of high reactivity. Different techniques are to be used for obtaining the metals falling in each category.\n\nSeveral steps are involved in the extraction of pure metal from ores. A summary of these steps is given in Fig.3.10. Each step is explained in detail in the following sections.\n\n![](images/59cb5646aeef92b77a3fa6a7df6c151fbe3c72988050f843870fff6944d42db1.jpg)\n\n#### 3.4.2 Enrichment of Ores\n\nOres mined from the earth are usually contaminated with large amounts of impurities such as soil, sand, etc., called gangue. The impurities must be removed from the ore prior to the extraction of the metal. The processes\n\nused for removing the gangue from the ore are based on the differences between the physical or chemical properties of the gangue and the ore. Different separation techniques are accordingly employed.\n\n#### 3.4.3 Extracting Metals Low in the Activity Series\n\nMetals low in the activity series are very unreactive. The oxides of these metals can be reduced to metals by heating alone. For example, cinnabar (HgS) is an ore of mercury. When it is heated in air, it is first converted into mercuric oxide (HgO). Mercuric oxide is then reduced to mercury on further heating.\n\n$$\n2 \\mathrm {H g S} (\\mathrm {s}) + 3 \\mathrm {O} _ {2} (\\mathrm {g}) \\xrightarrow {\\text {H e a t}} 2 \\mathrm {H g O} (\\mathrm {s}) + 2 \\mathrm {S O} _ {2} (\\mathrm {g})\n$$",

These are usually present as sulphides or carbonates in nature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide, as compared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to reduction, the metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal oxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating strongly in the presence of excess air. This process is known as roasting. The carbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited air. This process is known as calcination. The chemical reaction that takes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown as follows – Roasting\n\n$$\n2 \\mathrm {Z n S (s)} + 3 \\mathrm {O} _ {2} (\\mathrm {g}) \\xrightarrow {\\text {H e a t}} 2 \\mathrm {Z n O (s)} + 2 \\mathrm {S O} _ {2} (\\mathrm {g})\n$$\n\nCalcination\n\n$$\n\\mathrm {Z n C O} _ {3} (\\mathrm {s}) \\xrightarrow {\\text {H e a t}} \\mathrm {Z n O} (\\mathrm {s}) + \\mathrm {C O} _ {2} (\\mathrm {g})\n$$\n\nThe metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by using suitable reducing agents such as carbon. For example, when zinc oxide is heated with carbon, it is reduced to metallic zinc.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm {Z n O (s) + C (s) \\rightarrow Z n (s) + C O (g)}\n$$\n\nYou are already familiar with the process of oxidation and reduction explained in the first Chapter. Obtaining metals from their compounds is also a reduction process.\n\nBesides using carbon (coke) to reduce metal oxides to metals, sometimes displacement reactions can also be used. The highly reactive metals such as sodium, calcium, aluminium, etc., are used as reducing agents because they can displace metals of lower reactivity from their compounds. For example, when manganese dioxide is heated with aluminium powder, the following reaction takes place –",

The amount of heat evolved is so large that\n\nthe metals are produced in the molten state. In fact, the reaction of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) with aluminium is used to join railway tracks or cracked machine parts. This reaction is known as the thermit reaction.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm {F e} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} _ {3} (\\mathrm {s}) + 2 \\mathrm {A l} (\\mathrm {s}) \\rightarrow 2 \\mathrm {F e} (\\mathrm {l}) + \\mathrm {A l} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} _ {3} (\\mathrm {s}) + \\text {H e a t}\n$$\n\n#### 3.4.5 Extracting Metals towards the Top of the Activity Series\n\nThe metals high up in the reactivity series are very reactive. They cannot be obtained from their compounds by heating with carbon. For example, carbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium, calcium, aluminium, etc., to the respective metals. This is because these metals have more affinity for oxygen than carbon. These metals are obtained by electrolytic reduction. For example, sodium, magnesium and calcium are obtained by the electrolysis of their molten chlorides. The metals are deposited at the cathode (the negatively charged electrode), whereas, chlorine is liberated at the anode (the positively charged electrode). The reactions are –\n\nAt cathode\n\nAt anode\n\nSimilarly, aluminium is obtained by the electrolytic reduction of aluminium oxide.\n\n#### 3.4.6 Refining of Metals\n\nThe metals produced by various reduction processes described above are not very pure. They contain impurities, which must be removed to obtain pure metals. The most widely used method for refining impure metals is electrolytic refining.\n\nElectrolytic Refining: Many metals, such as copper, zinc, tin, nickel, silver, gold, etc., are refined electrolytically. In this process, the impure metal is made the anode and a thin strip\n\nof pure metal is made the cathode. A solution of the metal salt is used as an electrolyte. The apparatus is set up as shown in Fig. 3.12. On passing the current through the electrolyte, the pure metal from the anode dissolves into\n\nFigure 3.12   \n![](images/b7e301982b35681f3245795ecb5c70691e0907c47b413f8cb3277ae54bd32e61.jpg)  \nElectrolytic refining of copper. The electrolyte is a solution of acidified copper sulphate. The anode is impure copper, whereas, the cathode is a strip of pure copper. On passing electric current, pure copper is deposited on the cathode.\n\nthe electrolyte. An equivalent amount of pure metal from the electrolyte is deposited on the cathode. The soluble impurities go into the solution, whereas, the insoluble impurities settle down at the bottom of the anode and are known as anode mud.",

The oil will float on water and prevent the air from dissolving in the water.   \n■ Put some anhydrous calcium chloride in test tube C and cork it. Anhydrous calcium chloride will absorb the moisture, if any, from the air. Leave these test tubes for a few days and then observe (Fig. 3.13).\n\nYou will observe that iron nails rust in test tube A, but they do not rust in test tubes B and C. In the test tube A, the nails are exposed to both air and water. In the test tube B, the nails are exposed to only water, and the nails in test tube C are exposed to dry air. What does this tell us about the conditions under which iron articles rust?\n\n#### 3.5.1 Prevention of Corrosion\n\nThe rusting of iron can be prevented by painting, oiling, greasing, galvanising, chrome plating, anodising or making alloys.\n\nGalvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting by coating them with a thin layer of zinc. The galvanised article is protected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you reason this out?\n\nAlloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal. We can get the desired properties by this method. For example, iron is the most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is because pure iron is very soft and stretches\n\neasily when hot. But, if it is mixed with a small amount of carbon (about $0 . 0 5 \\%$ ), it becomes hard and strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get stainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed with some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties of any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance. The substance added may be a metal or a non-metal. An alloy is a homogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a non-metal. It is prepared by first melting the primary metal, and then, dissolving the other elements in it in definite proportions. It is then cooled to room temperature.",

We saw that ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points and conduct electricity in solution or in the molten state. We also\n\nsaw how the nature of bonding in ionic compounds explains these properties. Let us now study the properties of some carbon compounds.\n\nMost carbon compounds are poor conductors of electricity as we have seen in Chapter 2. From the data given in Table 4.1 on the boiling and melting points of the carbon compounds, we find that these compounds have low melting and boiling points as compared to ionic compounds (Chapter 3). We can conclude that the forces of attraction between the molecules are not very strong. Since these compounds are largely nonconductors of electricity, we can conclude that the bonding in these compounds does not give rise to any ions.\n\nTable 4.1 Melting points and boiling points of some compounds of carbon   \n\n<table><tr><td>Compound</td><td>Melting point (K)</td><td>Boiling point (K)</td></tr><tr><td>Acetic acid (CH3COOH)</td><td>290</td><td>391</td></tr><tr><td>Chloroform (CHCl3)</td><td>209</td><td>334</td></tr><tr><td>Ethanol (CH3CH2OH)</td><td>156</td><td>351</td></tr><tr><td>Methane (CH4)</td><td>90</td><td>111</td></tr></table>\n\nIn Class IX, we learnt about the combining capacity of various elements and how it depends on the number of valence electrons. Let us now look at the electronic configuration of carbon. The atomic number of carbon is 6. What would be the distribution of electrons in various shells of carbon? How many valence electrons will carbon have?\n\nWe know that the reactivity of elements is explained as their tendency to attain a completely filled outer shell, that is, attain noble gas configuration. Elements forming ionic compounds achieve this by either gaining or losing electrons from the outermost shell. In the case of carbon, it has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs to gain or lose four electrons to attain noble gas configuration. If it were to gain or lose electrons –\n\n(i) It could gain four electrons forming $\\mathrm { C } ^ { 4 - }$ anion. But it would be difficult for the nucleus with six protons to hold on to ten electrons, that is, four extra electrons.   \n(ii) It could lose four electrons forming $\\mathrm { C } ^ { 4 + }$ cation. But it would require a large amount of energy to remove four electrons leaving behind a carbon cation with six protons in its nucleus holding on to just two electrons.\n\nCarbon overcomes this problem by sharing its valence electrons with other atoms of carbon or with atoms of other elements. Not just carbon, but many other elements form molecules by sharing electrons in this manner. The shared electrons ‘belong’ to the outermost shells of both the atoms and lead to both atoms attaining the noble gas configuration. Before going on to compounds of carbon, let us look at some simple molecules formed by the sharing of valence electrons.",

    "text": "The element carbon occurs in different forms in nature with widely varying physical properties. Both diamond and graphite are formed by carbon atoms, the difference lies in the manner in which the carbon atoms are bonded to one another. In diamond, each carbon atom is bonded to\n\nfour other carbon atoms forming a rigid three-dimensional structure. In graphite, each carbon atom is bonded to three other carbon atoms in the same plane giving a hexagonal array. One of these bonds is a double-bond, and thus the valency of carbon is satisfied. Graphite structure is formed by the hexagonal arrays being placed in layers one above the other.\n\n![](images/184861319bdec0d0565e4072f2308a71ddad5cc482e116c0afe92d724ec8d038.jpg)  \nThe structure of diamond\n\n![](images/315f28dbca0a366d811849922b6605b08fe0d38c71f7c08ed7e8e4da89ce8394.jpg)  \nThe structure of graphite\n\n![](images/94dd7fdbecef8e36c363712cecb56d9a081bb9cb487eea6770c01c54b046272e.jpg)  \nThe structure of C-60   \nBuckminsterfullerene\n\nThese two different structures result in diamond and graphite having very different physical properties even though their chemical properties are the same.

Graphite is\n\nalso a very good conductor of electricity unlike other non-metals that you studied in the previous Chapter.\n\nDiamonds can be synthesised by subjecting pure carbon to very high pressure and temperature. These synthetic diamonds are small but are otherwise indistinguishable from natural diamonds.\n\nFullerenes form another class of carbon allotropes. The first one to be identified was C-60 which has carbon atoms arranged in the shape of a football. Since this looked like the geodesic dome designed by the US architect Buckminster Fuller, the molecule was named fullerene.",

What would be the electron dot structure of a molecule of sulphur which is made up of eight atoms of sulphur? (Hint – The eight atoms of sulphur are joined together in the form of a ring.)\n\n### 4.2 VERSATILE NATURE OFCARBON\n\nWe have seen the formation of covalent bonds by the sharing of electrons in various elements and compounds. We have also seen the structure of a simple carbon compound, methane. In the beginning of the Chapter, we saw how many things we use contain carbon. In fact, we ourselves are made up of carbon compounds. The numbers of carbon compounds whose formulae are known to chemists was recently estimated to be in millions! This outnumbers by a large margin the compounds formed by all the other elements put together. Why is it that this property is seen in carbon and no other element? The nature of the covalent bond\n\nenables carbon to form a large number of compounds. Two factors noticed in the case of carbon are –\n\n(i) Carbon has the unique ability to form bonds with other atoms of carbon, giving rise to large molecules. This property is called catenation. These compounds may have long chains of carbon, branched chains of carbon or even carbon atoms arranged in rings. In addition, carbon atoms may be linked by single, double or triple bonds. Compounds of carbon, which are linked by only single bonds between the carbon atoms are called saturated compounds. Compounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between their carbon atoms are called unsaturated compounds.   \nNo other element exhibits the property of catenation to the extent seen in carbon compounds. Silicon forms compounds with hydrogen which have chains of upto seven or eight atoms, but these compounds are very reactive. The carbon-carbon bond is very strong and hence stable. This gives us the large number of compounds with many carbon atoms linked to each other.   \n(ii) Since carbon has a valency of four, it is capable of bonding with four other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other mono-valent element. Compounds of carbon are formed with oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, chlorine and many other elements giving rise to compounds with specific properties which depend on the elements other than carbon present in the molecule.\n\nAgain the bonds that carbon forms with most other elements are very strong making these compounds exceptionally stable. One reason for the formation of strong bonds by carbon is its small size. This enables the nucleus to hold on to the shared pairs of electrons strongly. The bonds formed by elements having bigger atoms are much weaker.",

    "text": "The two characteristic features seen in carbon, that is, tetravalency and catenation, put together give rise to a large number of compounds. Many have the same noncarbon atom or group of atoms attached to different carbon chains. These compounds were initially extracted from natural substances and it was thought that these carbon compounds or organic compounds could only be formed within a living system. That is, it was postulated that a ‘vital force’ was necessary for their synthesis. Friedrich Wöhler disproved this in 1828 by preparing urea from ammonium cyanate. But carbon compounds, except for carbides, oxides of carbon, carbonate and hydrogencarbonate salts continue to be studied under organic chemistry.\n\n#### 4.2.1 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds\n\nWe have already seen the structure of methane. Another compound formed between carbon and hydrogen is ethane with a formula of $\\mathrm { C } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { H } _ { 6 }$ . In order to arrive at the structure of simple carbon compounds, the first step is to link the carbon atoms together with a single bond (Fig. 4.6a) and then use the hydrogen atoms to satisfy the remaining valencies of carbon (Fig. 4.6b). For example, the structure of ethane is arrived in the following steps –\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l} \\mathrm {C} - \\mathrm {C} & \\mathrm {S t e p 1} \\end{array}\n$$\n\nFigure 4.6 (a)\n\nCarbon atoms linked together with a single bond\n\nThree valencies of each carbon atom remain unsatisfied, so each is bonded to three hydrogen atoms giving:\n\n![](images/b765885ef59e1341c4a7b3cb700a797483eaf9e065f0540f98ca865ed41685c2.jpg)  \nFigure 4.6 (b)   \nEach carbon atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms\n\n![](images/322e9564d73fc573bb8c427c5198c8dd74476739790f0ec6c20fa99ee601411b.jpg)  \nFigure 4.6 (c)   \nElectron dot structure of ethane\n\nThe electron dot structure of ethane is shown in Fig. 4.6(c).\n\nCan you draw the structure of propane, which has the molecular formula $\\mathrm { C } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { H } _ { 8 }$ in a similar manner? You will see that the valencies of all the atoms are satisfied by single bonds between them. Such carbon compounds are called saturated compounds. These compounds are normally not very reactive.\n\nHowever, another compound of carbon and hydrogen has the formula $\\mathrm { C } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { H } _ { 4 }$ and is called ethene. How can this molecule be depicted? We follow the same step-wise approach as above.\n\nCarbon-carbon atoms linked together with a single bond (Step 1).\n\nWe see that one valency per carbon atom remains unsatisfied (Step 2). This can be satisfied only if there is a double bond between the two carbons (Step 3).\n\n![](images/10b56a6cbf7706c1cb794a110da7ba8a3d1efa87aaf8a44f756bd022e69deba3.jpg)  \nStep 1   \nStep 2\n\n![](images/590026de53cadaa00a6f4a109571ac7c05052c47d4c4e28f0ace86a5438bd31f.jpg)  \nStep 3\n\n![](images/b31476932ceb61c7abb7526ad5f5a894118718ae00573f5e613dd6479e20b8df.jpg)  \nFigure 4.7 Structure of ethene\n\nThe electron dot structure for ethene is given in Fig. 4.7.

Such compounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between the carbon atoms are known as unsaturated carbon compounds and they are more reactive than the saturated carbon compounds.\n\n#### 4.2.2 Chains, Branches and Rings\n\nIn the earlier section, we mentioned the carbon compounds methane, ethane and propane, containing respectively 1, 2 and 3 carbon atoms. Such ‘chains’ of carbon atoms can contain many more carbon atoms.

Such compounds with identical molecular formula but different structures are called structural isomers.\n\nIn addition to straight and branched carbon chains, some compounds have carbon atoms arranged in the form of a ring. For example, cyclohexane has the formula $\\mathrm { C } _ { 6 } \\mathrm { H } _ { 1 2 }$ and the following structure\n\n![](images/fb3e4f48eccd859f82f0e8ae9280f23f6749ec95b4b5c35d0bab76e63ea5e118.jpg)  \n(a)\n\n![](images/20ef2832476f4a463668bdfa3daa8803815d4c485424584e4c29610c71a7e6a2.jpg)  \n(b)   \nFigure 4.9 Structure of cyclohexane (a) carbon skeleton (b) complete molecule\n\nCan you draw the electron dot structure for cyclohexane? Straight chain, branched chain and cyclic carbon compounds, all may be saturated or unsaturated.

Among these, the saturated hydrocarbons are called alkanes. The unsaturated hydrocarbons which contain one or more double bonds are called alkenes. Those containing one or more triple bonds are called alkynes.\n\n#### 4.2.3 Will you be my Friend?",

    "text": "Carbon seems to be a very friendly element. So far we have been looking at compounds containing carbon and hydrogen only. But carbon also forms bonds with other elements such as halogens, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur. In a hydrocarbon chain, one or more hydrogens can be replaced by these elements, such that the valency of carbon remains satisfied. In such compounds, the element replacing hydrogen is referred to as a heteroatom. These heteroatoms are also present in some groups as given in Table 4.3. These heteroatoms and the group containing these confer specific properties to the compound, regardless of the length and nature of the carbon chain and hence are called functional groups. Some important functional groups are given in the Table 4.3. Free valency or valencies of the group are shown by the single line. The functional group is attached to the carbon chain through this valency by replacing one hydrogen atom or atoms.\n\nTable 4.3 Some functional groups in carbon compounds   \n\n<table><tr><td>Hetero atom</td><td>Class of Compounds</td><td>Formula of functional group</td></tr><tr><td>Cl/Br</td><td>Halo- (Chloro/bromo) alkane</td><td>—Cl, —Br \n(substitutes for hydrogen atom)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"4\">Oxygen</td><td>1.

These chains can be branched also. In addition, hydrogen atom or other atoms on these carbon chains can be replaced by any of the functional groups that we saw above. The presence of a functional group such as alcohol decides the properties of the carbon compound, regardless of the length of the carbon chain. For example, the chemical properties of $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { O H }$ , $\\mathrm { C _ { 2 } H _ { 5 } O H }$ , $\\mathrm { C } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { H } _ { 7 } \\mathrm { O H }$ and $\\mathrm { C _ { 4 } H _ { 9 } O H }$ are all very similar.

For example, the names\n\nof the alcohols taken in Activity 4.2 are methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol.\n\nNaming a carbon compound can be done by the following method –\n\n(i) Identify the number of carbon atoms in the compound. A compound having three carbon atoms would have the name propane.   \n(ii) In case a functional group is present, it is indicated in the name of the compound with either a prefix or a suffix (as given in Table 4.4).   \n(iii) If the name of the functional group is to be given as a suffix, and the suffix of the functional group begins with a vowel a, e, i, o, u, then the name of the carbon chain is modified by deleting the final ‘e’ and adding the appropriate suffix. For example, a three-carbon chain with a ketone group would be named in the following manner –\n\nPropane – ‘e’ $=$ propan $^ +$ ‘one’ $=$ propanone.\n\n(iv) If the carbon chain is unsaturated, then the final ‘ane’in the name of the carbon chain is substituted by ‘ene’ or ‘yne’ as given in Table 4.4.

This results in a sooty deposit on\n\nthe metal plate in Activity 4.3. However, limiting the supply of air results in incomplete combustion of even saturated hydrocarbons giving a sooty flame. The gas/kerosene stove used at home has inlets for air so that a sufficiently oxygen-rich mixture is burnt to give a clean blue flame. If you observe the bottoms of cooking vessels getting blackened, it means that the air holes are blocked and fuel is getting wasted.

They were pressed down by layers of earth and rock. They slowly decayed into coal. Oil and gas are the remains of millions of tiny plants and animals that lived in the sea. When they died, their bodies sank to the sea bed and were covered by silt. Bacteria attacked the dead remains, turning them into oil and gas under the high pressures they were being subjected to. Meanwhile, the silt was slowly compressed into rock. The oil and gas seeped into the porous parts of the rock, and got trapped like water in a sponge.

Carbon compounds can be easily oxidised on combustion. In addition to this complete oxidation, we have reactions in which alcohols are converted to carboxylic acids –\n\n$$\n\\mathrm {C H} _ {3} - \\mathrm {C H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O H} \\xrightarrow [ \\text {O r a c i d i f i e d K} _ {2} \\mathrm {C r} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} _ {7} + \\text {H e a t} \\mathrm {C H} _ {3} \\mathrm {C O O H}\n$$\n\nWe see that some substances are capable of adding oxygen to others. These substances are known as oxidising agents.\n\nAlkaline potassium permanganate or acidified potassium dichromate are oxidising alcohols to acids, that is, adding oxygen to the starting material. Hence they are known as oxidising agents.\n\n#### 4.3.3 Addition Reaction\n\nUnsaturated hydrocarbons add hydrogen in the presence of catalysts such as palladium or nickel to give saturated hydrocarbons. Catalysts are substances that cause a reaction to occur or proceed at a different rate without the reaction itself being affected. This reaction is commonly used in the hydrogenation of vegetable oils using a nickel catalyst. Vegetable oils generally have long unsaturated carbon chains while animal fats have saturated carbon chains.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c} \\mathrm {R} \\\\ \\mathrm {R} \\end{array} \\mathrm {C} = \\mathrm {C} \\begin{array}{c} \\mathrm {R} \\\\ \\mathrm {R} \\end{array} \\xrightarrow {\\text {N i c k e l c a t a l y s t}} \\mathrm {R} - \\begin{array}{c} \\mathrm {H} \\\\ \\mathrm {C} \\\\ \\mathrm {R} \\end{array} - \\begin{array}{c} \\mathrm {H} \\\\ \\mathrm {C} \\\\ \\mathrm {R} \\end{array} - \\begin{array}{c} \\mathrm {R} \\\\ \\mathrm {C} \\\\ \\mathrm {R} \\end{array}\n$$\n\nYou must have seen advertisements stating that some vegetable oils are ‘healthy’. Animal fats generally contain saturated fatty acids which are said to be harmful for health. Oils containing unsaturated fatty acids should be chosen for cooking.\n\n#### 4.3.4 Substitution Reaction\n\nSaturated hydrocarbons are fairly unreactive and are inert in the presence of most reagents. However, in the presence of sunlight, chlorine is added to hydrocarbons in a very fast reaction. Chlorine can replace the hydrogen atoms one by one. It is called a substitution reaction because one type of atom or a group of atoms takes the place of another. A number of products are usually formed with the higher homologues of alkanes.",

Most dirt is oily in nature and as you know, oil does not dissolve in water. The molecules of soap are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain carboxylic acids. The ionicend of soap interacts with water while the carbon chain interacts with oil. The soap molecules, thus form structures called micelles (see Fig. 4.12) where one end of the molecules is towards the oil droplet while the ionic-end faces outside. This forms an emulsion in water. The soap micelle thus helps in pulling out the dirt in water and we can wash our clothes clean (Fig. 4.13).\n\nCan you draw the structure of the micelle that would be formed if you dissolve soap in a hydrocarbon?",

During the day, the sunlight helps us to see objects. An object reflects light that falls on it. This reflected light, when received by our eyes, enables us to see things. We are able to see through a transparent medium as light is transmitted through it. There are a number of common wonderful phenomena associated with light such as image formation by mirrors, the twinkling of stars, the beautiful colours of a rainbow, bending of light by a medium and so on. A study of the properties of light helps us to explore them.\n\nBy observing the common optical phenomena around us, we may conclude that light seems to travel in straight lines. The fact that a small source of light casts a sharp shadow of an opaque object points to this straight-line path of light, usually indicated as a ray of light.",

    "text": "If an opaque object on the path of light becomes very small, light has a tendency to bend around it and not walk in a straight line – an effect known as the diffraction of light. Then the straight-line treatment of optics using rays fails. To explain phenomena such as diffraction, light is thought of as a wave, the details of which you will study in higher classes. Again, at the beginning of the 20th century, it became known that the wave theory of light often becomes inadequate for treatment of the interaction of light with\n\nmatter, and light often behaves somewhat like a stream of particles. This confusion about the true nature of light continued for some years till a modern quantum theory of light emerged in which light is neither a ‘wave’ nor a ‘particle’ – the new theory reconciles the particle properties of light with the wave nature.\n\nIn this Chapter, we shall study the phenomena of reflection and refraction of light using the straight-line propagation of light. These basic concepts will help us in the study of some of the optical phenomena in nature. We shall try to understand in this Chapter the reflection of light by spherical mirrors and refraction of light and their application in real life situations.",

It may damage your eyes.\n\nHold a concave mirror in your hand and direct its reflecting surface towards the Sun.   \n■ Direct the light reflected by the mirror on to a sheet of paper held close to the mirror.   \nMove the sheet of paper back and forth gradually until you find on the paper sheet a bright, sharp spot of light.   \nHold the mirror and the paper in the same position for a few minutes. What do you observe? Why?\n\nThe paper at first begins to burn producing smoke. Eventually it may even catch fire. Why does it burn? The light from the Sun is converged at a point, as a sharp, bright spot bythe mirror. In fact, this spot of light is the image of the Sun on the sheet of paper. This point is the focus of the concave mirror. The heat produced due to the concentration of sunlight ignites the paper. The distance of this image from the position of the mirror gives the approximate value of focal length of the mirror.\n\nLet us try to understand this observation with the help of a ray diagram.\n\nObserve Fig.9.2 (a) closely. Anumber of rays parallel to the principal axis are falling on a concave mirror. Observe the reflected rays. They are all meeting/intersecting at a point on the principal axis of the mirror. This point is called the principal focus of the concave mirror. Similarly, observe Fig. 9.2 (b). How are the rays parallel to the principal axis, reflected by a convex mirror? The reflected rays appear to come from a point on the principal axis. This point is called the principal focus of the convex mirror. The principal focus is represented by the letter F.

The surface, then, has a circular outline. The diameter of the reflecting surface of spherical mirror is called its aperture. In Fig.9.2, distance MN represents the aperture. We shall consider in our discussion only such spherical mirrors whose aperture is much smaller than its radius of curvature.\n\nIs there a relationship between the radius of curvature R, and focal length f, of a spherical mirror? For spherical mirrors of small apertures, the radius of curvature is found to be equal to twice the focal length. We put this as $\\mathrm { R } = 2 f$ .

In Activity 9.2, you have seen that the sharp bright spot of light you got on the paper is, in fact, the image of the Sun. It was a tiny, real, inverted image. You got the approximate focal length of the concave mirror by measuring the distance of the image from the mirror.\n\n■ Take a concave mirror. Find out its approximate focal length in the way described above. Note down the value of focal length. (You can also find it out by obtaining image of a distant object on a sheet of paper.)   \n■ Mark a line on a Table with a chalk. Place the concave mirror on a stand. Place the stand over the line such that its pole lies over the line.   \n■ Draw with a chalk two more lines parallel to the previous line such that the distance between any two successive lines is equal to the focal length of the mirror. These lines will now correspond to the positions of the points P, F and C, respectively. Remember – For a spherical mirror of small aperture, the principal focus F lies mid-way between the pole P and the centre of curvature C.   \n■ Keep a bright object, say a burning candle, at a position far beyond C. Place a paper screen and move it in front of the mirror till you obtain a sharp bright image of the candle flame on it.   \n■ Observe the image carefully. Note down its nature, position and relative size with respect to the object size.   \nRepeat the activity by placing the c a n d l e – ( a ) j u s t b e y o n d C , (b) at C, (c) between F and C, (d) at F, and (e) between P and F.   \n■ In one of the cases, you may not get the image on the screen. Identify the position of the object in such a case. Then, look for its virtual image in the mirror itself.   \nNote down and tabulate your observations.\n\nYou will see in the above Activity that the nature, position and size of the image formed by a concave mirror depends on the position of the object in relation to points P, F and C. The image formed is real for some positions of the object. It is found to be a virtual image for a certain other position. The image is either magnified, reduced or has the same size, depending on the position of the object.

Consider an extended object, of finite size, placed in front of a spherical mirror. Each small portion of the extended object acts like a point source. An infinite number of rays originate from each of these points. To construct the ray diagrams, in order to locate the image of an\n\nobject, an arbitrarily large number of rays emanating from a point could be considered. However, it is more convenient to consider only two rays, for the sake of clarity of the ray diagram. These rays are so chosen that it is easy to know their directions after reflection from the mirror.\n\nThe intersection of at least two reflected rays give the position of image of the point object.

    "text": "Convex mirrors are commonly used as rear-view (wing) mirrors in vehicles. These mirrors are fitted on the sides of the vehicle, enabling the driver to see traffic behind him/her to facilitate safe driving. Convex mirrors are preferred because they always give an erect, though diminished, image. Also, they have a wider field of view as they are curved outwards. Thus, convex mirrors enable the driver to view much larger area than would be possible with a plane mirror.\n\n## \n\n1. Define the principal focus of a concave mirror.   \n2. The radius of curvature of a spherical mirror is $2 0 \\mathrm { c m }$ . What is its focal length?   \n3. Name a mirror that can give an erect and enlarged image of an object.   \n4. Why do we prefer a convex mirror as a rear-view mirror in vehicles?\n\n#### 9.2.3 Sign Convention for Reflection by Spherical Mirrors\n\nWhile dealing with the reflection of light by spherical mirrors, we shall follow a set of sign conventions called the New Cartesian Sign Convention. In this convention, the pole (P) of the mirror is taken as the origin (Fig. 9.9). The principal axis of the mirror is taken as the x-axis $( \\mathrm { { X } } ^ { \\prime } \\mathrm { { X } } )$ of the coordinate system. The conventions are as follows –\n\n(i) The object is always placed to the left of the mirror. This implies that the light from the object falls on the mirror from the lefthand side.   \n(ii) All distances parallel to the principal axis are measured from the pole of the mirror.   \n(iii) All the distances measured to the right of the origin (along + x-axis) are taken as positive while those measured to the left of the origin (along – x-axis) are taken as negative.   \n(iv) Distances measured perpendicular to and above the principal axis (along + y-axis) are taken as positive.   \n(v) Distances measured perpendicular to and below the principal axis (along –y-axis) are taken as negative.\n\nThe New Cartesian Sign Convention described above is illustrated in Fig.9.9 for your reference. These sign conventions are applied to obtain the mirror formula and solve related numerical problems.\n\n![](images/f92b5688a5d555b397ec177b0b51f2915cc3c5debba907370c069becb7ef8a96.jpg)  \nFigure 9.9 The New Cartesian Sign Convention for spherical mirrors\n\n#### 9.2.4 Mirror Formula and Magnification\n\nIn a spherical mirror, the distance of the object from its pole is called the object distance (u). The distance of the image from the pole of the mirror is called the image distance (v). You already know that the distance of the principal focus from the pole is called the focal length (f). There is a relationship between these three quantities given by the mirror formula which is expressed as\n\n$$\n\\frac {1}{v} + \\frac {1}{u} = \\frac {1}{f} \\tag {9.1}\n$$\n\nThis formula is valid in all situations for all spherical mirrors for all positions of the object. You must use the New Cartesian Sign Convention while substituting numerical values for u, v, f, and R in the mirror formula for solving problems.",

    "text": "Light seems to travel along straight-line paths in a transparent medium. What happens when light enters from one transparent medium to another? Does it still move along a straightline path or change its direction? We shall recall some of our day-to-day experiences.\n\nYou might have observed that the bottom of a tank or a pond containing water appears to be raised. Similarly, when a thick glass slab is placed over some printed matter, the letters appear raised when viewed through the glass slab. Why does it happen? Have you seen a pencil partly immersed in water in a glass tumbler? It appears to be displaced at the interface of air and water. You might have observed that a lemon kept in water in a glass tumbler appears to be bigger than its actual size, when viewed from the sides. How can you account for such experiences?\n\nLet us consider the case of the apparent displacement of a pencil, partly immersed in water. The light reaching you from the portion of the pencil inside water seems to come from a different direction, compared to the part above water. This makes the pencil appear to be displaced at the interface. For similar reasons, the letters appear to be raised, when seen through a glass slab placed over it.\n\nDoes a pencil appear to be displaced to the same extent, if instead of water, we use liquids like kerosene or turpentine? Will the letters appear to rise to the same height if we replace a glass slab with a transparent plastic slab? You will find that the extent of the effect is different for different pair of media. These observations indicate that light does not travel in the same direction in all media. It appears that when travelling obliquely from one medium to another, the direction of propagation of light in the second medium changes. This phenomenon is known as refraction of light. Let us understand this phenomenon further by doing a few activities.",

    "text": "Now you are familiar with the refraction of light. Refraction is due to change in the speed of light as it enters from one transparent medium to another. Experiments show that refraction of light occurs according to certain laws.\n\nThe following are the laws of refraction of light.\n\n(i) The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interface of two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.   \n(ii) The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is a constant, for the light of a given colour and for the given pair of media. This law is also known as Snell’s law of refraction. (This is true for angle $0 < \\mathrm { i } < 9 0 ^ { \\mathrm { o } }$ )\n\nIf i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction, then,\n\n$$\n\\frac {\\sin i}{\\sin r} = \\text {c o n s t a n t} \\tag {9.4}\n$$\n\nThis constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first. Let us study about refractive index in some detail.\n\n#### 9.3.2 The Refractive Index\n\nYou have already studied that a ray of light that travels obliquely from one transparent medium into another will change its direction in the second medium. The extent of the change in direction that takes place in a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index, the “constant” appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4).\n\nThe refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity, the relative speed of propagation of light in different media. It turns out that light propagates with different speeds in different media. Light travels fastest in vacuum with speed of $3 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { 8 } \\mathrm { m } \\mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ . In air, the speed of light is only marginally less, compared\n\nto that in vacuum. It reduces considerably in glass or water. The value of the refractive index for a given pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as given below.\n\nConsider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as shown in Fig.9.11. Let $\\mathbf { V } _ { 1 }$ be the speed of light in medium 1 and $\\mathbf { V } _ { 2 }$ be the speed of light in medium 2. The refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and the speed of light in medium 2. This is usually represented by the symbol $\\mathbf { n } _ { 2 1 }$ . This can be expressed in an equation form as",

    "text": "The ability of a medium to refract light is also expressed in terms of its optical density. Optical density has a definite connotation. It is not the same as mass density. We have been using the terms ‘rarer medium’ and ‘denser medium’ in this Chapter. It actually means ‘optically rarer medium’ and ‘optically denser medium’, respectively. When can we say that a medium is optically denser than the other? In comparing two media, the one with the larger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other. The other medium of lower refractive index is optically rarer. The speed of light is higher in a rarer medium than a denser medium. Thus, a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to a denser medium slows down and bends towards the normal. When it travels from a denser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal.\n\n## \n\n1. A ray of light travelling in air enters obliquely into water. Does the light ray bend towards the normal or away from the normal? Why?   \n2. Light enters from air to glass having refractive index 1.50. What is the speed of light in the glass?

    "text": "A transparent material bound by two surfaces, of which one or both surfaces are spherical, forms a lens. This means that a lens is bound by at least one spherical surface. In such lenses, the other surface would be plane. A lens may have two spherical surfaces, bulging outwards. Such a lens is called a double convex lens. It is simply called a convex lens. It is thicker at the middle as compared to the edges. Convex lens converges light rays as shown in Fig. 9.12 (a). Hence convex lenses are also called converging lenses. Similarly, a double concave lens is bounded by two spherical surfaces, curved inwards. It is thicker at the edges than at the middle. Such lenses diverge light rays as shown in Fig. 9.12 (b). Such lenses are also called diverging lenses. A double concave lens is simply called a concave lens.\n\n![](images/db98f49c5092ef37ff7fea803b0f5e59419cbdc17bfa7feb4f79e69cd750824e.jpg)  \n(a)\n\nFigure 9.12   \n![](images/ecc025d208c547c33a73b6d8727bbbdfcc9d2340c58a9cbb89e7abba3db6f4c0.jpg)  \n(a) Converging action of a convex lens,   \n(b) diverging action of a concave lens\n\nA lens, either a convex lens or a concave lens, has two spherical surfaces. Each of these surfaces forms a part of a sphere. The centres of these spheres are called centres of curvature of the lens. The centre of curvature of a lens is usually represented by the letter C. Since there are two centres of curvature, we may represent them as $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ and $\\mathrm { C } _ { 2 }$ . An imaginary straight line passing through the two centres of curvature of a lens is called its principal axis. The central point of a lens is its optical centre. It is usually represented by the letter O. A ray of light through the optical centre of a lens passes without suffering any deviation. The effective diameter of the circular outline of a spherical lens is called its aperture. We shall confine our discussion in this Chapter to such lenses whose aperture is much less than its radius of curvature and the two centres of curvatures are equidistant from the optical centre O. Such lenses are called thin lenses with small apertures. What happens when parallel rays of light are incident on a lens? Let us do an Activity to understand this.",

    "text": "CAUTION: Do not look at the Sun directly or through a lens while doing this Activity or otherwise. You may damage your eyes if you do so.\n\n■ Hold a convex lens in your hand. Direct it towards the Sun.   \nFocus the light from the Sun on a sheet of paper. Obtain a sharp bright image of the Sun.   \n■ Hold the paper and the lens in the same position for a while. Keep observing the paper. What happened? Why? Recall your experience in Activity 9.2.\n\nThe paper begins to burn producing smoke. It may even catch fire after a while. Why does this happen? The light from the Sun constitutes parallel rays of light. These rays were converged by the lens at the sharp bright spot formed on the paper. In fact, the bright spot you got on the paper is a real image of the Sun. The concentration of the sunlight at a point generated heat. This caused the paper to burn.\n\nNow, we shall consider rays of light parallel to the principal axis of a lens. What happens when you pass such rays of light through a lens? This is illustrated for a convex lens in Fig.9.12 (a) and for a concave lens in Fig.9.12 (b).\n\nObserve Fig.9.12 (a) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the principal axis are falling on a convex lens. These rays, after refraction from the lens, are converging to a point on the principal axis. This point on the principal axis is called the principal focus of the lens. Let us see now the action of a concave lens.\n\nObserve Fig.9.12 (b) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the principal axis are falling on a concave lens. These rays, after refraction from the lens, are appearing to diverge from a point on the principal axis. This point on the principal axis is called the principal focus of the concave lens.\n\nIf you pass parallel rays from the opposite surface of the lens, you get another principal focus on the opposite side. Letter F is usually used to represent principal focus. However, a lens has two principal foci. They are represented by $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ and $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ . The distance of the principal focus from the optical centre of a lens is called its focal length. The letter $f$ is used to represent the focal length. How can you find the focal length of a convex lens? Recall the Activity 9.11. In this Activity, the distance between the position of the lens and the position of the image of the Sun gives the approximate focal length of the lens.\n\n#### 9.3.4 Image Formation by Lenses\n\nLenses form images by refracting light. How do lenses form images? What is their nature? Let us study this for a convex lens first.",

A concave lens will always give a virtual, erect and diminished image, irrespective of the position of the object.\n\n#### 9.3.5 Image Formation in Lenses Using Ray Diagrams\n\nWe can represent image formation by lenses using ray diagrams. Ray diagrams will also help us to study the nature, position and relative size of the image formed by lenses. For drawing ray diagrams in lenses, alike of spherical mirrors, we consider any two of the following rays –\n\n(i) A ray of light from the object, parallel to the principal axis, after refraction from a convex lens, passes through the principal focus on the other side of the lens, as shown in Fig. 9.13 (a). In case of a concave lens, the ray appears to diverge from the principal focus located on the same side of the lens, as shown in Fig. 9.13 (b).\n\n![](images/f80fc20226b767395b3d8de4faf0a970f9586a85b0d239830a24b1b53fb3acf7.jpg)\n\n![](images/92b9a40732428201dd21d9e4b3b57bca771884efde267d97b482469885e1a5b3.jpg)  \n(a)   \n(b)   \nFigure 9.13\n\n(ii) A ray of light passing through a principal focus, after refraction from a convex lens, will emerge parallel to the principal axis. This is shown in Fig. 9.14 (a). A ray of light appearing to meet at the principal focus of a concave lens, after refraction, will emerge parallel to the principal axis. This is shown in Fig.9.14 (b).\n\n![](images/33aaf0ff79cf3edcc6d8bc0aed13e5d5b594d232e03f1768098a2e91aeba5cdf.jpg)\n\n![](images/5de6bd07530e013580a2d8a7539c5f1910f4fdd529dc22575e8b0685c8d88fd5.jpg)  \nFigure 9.14\n\n(iii) A ray of light passing through the optical centre of a lens will emerge without any deviation.

We apply the rules for signs of distances, except that all measurements are taken from the optical centre of the lens. According to the convention, the focal length of a convex lens is positive and that of a concave lens is negative. You must take care to apply appropriate signs for the values of u, v, f, object height h and image height $h ^ { \\prime }$ .\n\n#### 9.3.7 Lens Formula and Magnification\n\nAs we have a formula for spherical mirrors, we also have formula for spherical lenses. This formula gives the relationship between objectdistance (u), image-distance (v) and the focal length (f). The lens formula is expressed as\n\n$$\n\\frac {1}{v} - \\frac {1}{u} = \\frac {1}{f} \\tag {9.8}\n$$\n\nThe lens formula given above is general and is valid in all situations for any spherical lens.

For example, a convex lens of short focal length bends the light rays through large angles, by focussing them closer to the optical centre. Similarly, concave lens of very short focal length causes higher divergence than the one with longer focal length. The degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved by a lens is expressed in terms of its power. The power of a lens is defined as the reciprocal of its focal length. It is represented by the letter $P$ . The power $P$ of a lens of focal length f is given by\n\n$$\nP = \\frac {1}{f} \\tag {9.11}\n$$",

During eye-testing, an optician puts several different combinations of corrective lenses of known power, in contact, inside the testing spectacles’ frame.

    "text": "The human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs. It enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us. On closing the eyes, we can identify objects to some extent by their smell, taste, sound they make or by touch. It is, however, impossible to identify colours while closing the eyes. Thus, of all the sense organs, the human eye is the most significant one as it enables us to see the beautiful, colourful world around us.\n\nThe human eye is like a camera. Its lens system forms an image on a light-sensitive screen called the retina. Light enters the eye through a thin membrane called the cornea. It forms the transparent bulge on the front surface of the eyeball as shown in Fig. 10.1. The eyeball is approximately spherical in shape with a diameter of about 2.3 cm. Most of the refraction for the light rays entering the eye occurs at the outer surface of the cornea. The crystalline lens merely provides the finer adjustment of focal length required to focus objects at different\n\ndistances on the retina. We find a structure called iris behind the cornea. Iris is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the size of the pupil. The pupil regulates and controls the amount of light entering the eye. The eye lens forms an inverted real image of the object on the retina. The retina is a delicate membrane having enormous number of light-sensitive cells. The light-sensitive cells get activated upon illumination and generate electrical signals. These signals are sent to the brain via the optic nerves. The brain interprets these signals, and finally, processes the information so that we perceive objects as they are.\n\n![](images/8ea946c66c5426cd400894304cdc3fa3ba761c37ddd57d68b50d57d023cc5cfb.jpg)  \nFigure 10.1 The human eye\n\n#### 10.1.1 Power of Accommodation\n\nThe eye lens is composed of a fibrous, jelly-like material. Its curvature can be modified to some extent by the ciliary muscles. The change in the curvature of the eye lens can thus change its focal length. When the muscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal length increases. This enables us to see distant objects clearly. When you are looking at objects closer to the eye, the ciliary muscles contract. This increases the curvature of the eye lens. The eye lens then becomes thicker. Consequently, the focal length of the eye lens decreases. This enables us to see nearby objects clearly.",

    "text": "You must have seen and appreciated the spectacular colours in a rainbow. How could the white light of the Sun give us various colours of the rainbow? Before we take up this question, we shall first go back to the refraction of light through a prism. The inclined refracting surfaces of a glass prism show exciting phenomenon. Let us find it out through an activity.\n\n### Activity 10.2\n\nTake a thick sheet of cardboard and make a small hole or narrow slit in its middle.   \n■ Allow sunlight to fall on the narrow slit. This gives a narrow beam of white light.   \nNow, take a glass prism and allow the light from the slit to fall on one of its faces as shown in Fig. 10.5.\n\n■ Turn the prism slowly until the light that comes out of it appears on a nearby screen.   \n■ What do you observe? You will find a beautiful band of colours. Why does this happen?\n\nThe prism has probably split the incident white light into a band of colours. Note the colours that appear at the two ends of the colour band. What is the sequence of colours that you see on the screen? The various colours seen are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange and Red, as shown in Fig. 10.5. The acronym VIBGYOR will help you to remember the sequence of colours. The band of the coloured components of a light beam is called its spectrum. You might not be able to see all the colours separately. Yet something makes each colour distinct from the other. The splitting of light into its component colours is called dispersion\n\n![](images/9270d646a97fdf62e45ecac81353d3ff86bcdea3e7c7d8704dd0750369d880ec.jpg)  \nFigure 10.5 Dispersion of white light by the glass prism\n\nYou have seen that white light is dispersed into its seven-colour components by a prism. Why do we get these colours? Different colours of light bend through different angles with respect to the incident ray, as they pass through a prism. The red light bends the least while the\n\nviolet the most. Thus the rays of each colour emerge along different paths and thus become distinct. It is the band of distinct colours that we see in a spectrum.\n\nIsaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain the spectrum of sunlight. He tried to split the colours of the spectrum of white light further by using another similar prism. However, he could not get any more colours. He then placed a second identical prism in an inverted position with respect to the first prism, as shown in Fig. 10.6. This allowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through the second prism. He found a beam of white light emerging from the other side of the second prism. This observation gave Newton the idea that the sunlight is made up of seven colours.\n\n![](images/4f6f8471baf95b5a3aad0e61231cdf2ce1cac468b6fa0821cd80df3b78331df4.jpg)  \nFigure 10.6 Recombination of the spectrum of white light\n\nAny light that gives a spectrum similar to that of sunlight is often referred to as white light.\n\n![](images/5ca36c0bd998cb4fe8d4b652fd8393d678bcf1c60c5a71f3545639a7c70636af.jpg)  \nFigure 10.7 Rainbow in the sky",

    "text": "You might have observed the apparent random wavering or flickering of objects seen through a turbulent stream of hot air rising above a fire or a radiator. The air just above the fire becomes hotter than the air further up. The hotter air is lighter (less dense) than the cooler air above it, and has a refractive index slightly\n\nless than that of the cooler air. Since the physical conditions of the refracting medium (air) are not stationary, the apparent position of the object, as seen through the hot air, fluctuates. This wavering is thus an effect of atmospheric refraction (refraction of light by the earth’s atmosphere) on a small scale in our local environment. The twinkling of stars is a similar phenomenon on a much larger scale. Let us see how we can explain it.",

    "text": "The twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight. The starlight, on entering the earth’s atmosphere, undergoes refraction continuously before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refraction occurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since the atmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position of the star is slightly different from its actual position. The star appears slightly higher (above) than its actual position when viewed near the horizon (Fig. 10.9). Further, this apparent position of the star is not stationary, but keeps on changing slightly, since the physical conditions of the earth’s atmosphere are not stationary, as was the case in the previous paragraph. Since the stars are very distant, they approximate point-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from the star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star fluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers – the star sometimes appears brighter, and at some other time, fainter, which is the twinkling effect.\n\n![](images/90f63b1dce11c58ad852fc803c67f09a03d4920e293208f16d6e3441d3b0b540.jpg)  \nApparent star position due to atmospheric refraction\n\nWhy don’t the planets twinkle? The planets are much closer to the earth, and are thus seen as extended sources. If we consider a planet as a collection of a large number of point-sized sources of light, the total variation in the amount of light entering our eye from all the individual point-sized sources will average out to zero, thereby nullifying the twinkling effect.",

    "text": "The interplay of light with objects around us gives rise to several spectacular phenomena in nature. The blue colour of the sky, colour of water in deep sea, the reddening of the sun at sunrise and the sunset are some of the wonderful phenomena we are familiar with. In the previous class, you have learnt about the scattering of light by colloidal particles. The path of a beam of light passing through a true solution is not visible. However, its path becomes visible through a colloidal solution where the size of the particles is relatively larger.\n\n#### 10.6.1 Tyndall Effect\n\nT h e e a r t h ’ s a t m o s p h e r e i s a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles. These particles include smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles of dust and molecules of air. When a beam of light strikes such fine particles, the path of the beam becomes visible. The light reaches us, after being reflected diffusely by these particles. The phenomenon of scattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect which you have studied in Class IX. This phenomenon is seen when a fine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole. Thus, scattering of light makes the particles visible. Tyndall effect can also be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense forest. Here, tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light.\n\nThe colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering particles. Very fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of larger size scatter light of longer wavelengths. If the size of the scattering particles is large enough, then, the scattered light may even appear white.\n\n#### 10.6.2Whyis thecolouroftheclearSkyBlue?\n\nThe molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size smaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in scattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer wavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about 1.8 times greater than blue light. Thus, when sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter wavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light\n\nenters our eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been any scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark. The sky appears dark to passengers flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not prominent at such heights.\n\nYou might have observed that ‘danger’ signal lights are red in colour. Do you know why? The red is least scattered by fog or smoke. Therefore, it can be seen in the same colour at a distance.",

How does it flow in an electric circuit? What are the factors that control or regulate the current through an electric circuit? In this Chapter, we shall attempt to answer such questions. We shall also discuss the heating effect of electric current and its applications.\n\n### 11.1ELECTRICCURRENTANDCIRCUIT\n\nWe are familiar with air current and water current. We know that flowing water constitute water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric charge flows through a conductor (for example, through a metallic wire), we say that there is an electric current in the conductor. In a torch, we know that the cells (or a battery, when placed in proper order) provide flow of charges or an electric current through the torch bulb to glow. We have also seen that the torch gives light only when its switch is on. What does a switch do? A switch makes a conducting link between the cell and the bulb. A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an electric circuit. Now, if the circuit is broken anywhere (or the switch of the torch is turned of f), the current stops flowing and the bulb does not glow.\n\nHow do we express electric current? Electric current is expressed by the amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. In other words, it is the rate of flow of electric charges. In circuits using metallic wires, electrons constitute the flow of charges. However, electrons were not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first observed. So, electric current was considered to be the flow of positive charges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the direction of electric current. Conventionally, in\n\nan electric circuit the direction of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the flow of electrons, which are negative charges.\n\nIf a net charge Q, flows across any crosssection of a conductor in time t, then the current I, through the cross-section is\n\n$$\nI = \\frac {Q}{t} \\tag {11.1}\n$$",

    "text": "What makes the electric charge to flow? Let us consider the analogy of flow of water. Charges do not flow in a copper wire by themselves, just as water in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tube is connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a pressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of the other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic wire, the gravity, of course, has no role to play; the electrons move only if there is a difference of electric pressure – called the potential difference – along the conductor. This difference of potential may be produced by a battery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within a cell generates the potential difference across the\n\nterminals of the cell, even when no current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a conducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in motion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order to maintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its chemical energy stored in it.\n\nWe define the electric potential difference between two points in an electric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit charge from one point to the other –\n\nPotential difference (V) between two points $=$ Work done (W)/Charge $( \\varrho )$\n\n$$\nV = W / Q \\tag {11.2}\n$$\n\nThe SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after Alessandro Volta (1745–1827), an Italian physicist.

Thus the $V { - } I$ graph is a straight line that passes through the origin of the graph, as shown in Fig. 11.3. Thus, V/I is a constant ratio.\n\nFigure 11.3   \n![](images/7c4d9a78cbc856be09ce181a8db29c7c067f61f56658f61b31760273f89121ff.jpg)  \nV–I graph for a nichrome wire. A straight line plot shows that as the current through a wire increases, the potential difference across the wire increases linearly – this is Ohm’s law.\n\nIn 1827, a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm (1787–1854) found out the relationship between the current I, flowing in a metallic wire and the potential difference across its terminals. The potential difference, V, across the ends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, provided its temperature remains the same. This is called Ohm’s law. In other words –\n\n$$\nV \\alpha I \\tag {11.4}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l} \\text {o r} & V / I & = \\quad \\text {c o n s t a n t} \\\\ & & = \\quad R \\end{array}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text {o r} \\quad V = I R \\tag {11.5}\n$$\n\nIn Eq. (11.4), R is a constant for the given metallic wire at a given temperature and is called its resistance. It is the property of a conductor to resist the flow of charges through it. Its SI unit is ohm, represented by the Greek letter Ω. According to Ohm’s law,\n\n$$\nR = V / I \\tag {11.6}\n$$",

Certain components offer an easy path for the flow of electric current while the others resist the flow. We know that motion of electrons in an electric circuit constitutes an electric current. The electrons, however, are not completely free to move within a conductor. They are restrained by the attraction of the atoms among which they move. Thus, motion of electrons through a conductor is retarded by its resistance. A component of a given size that offers a low resistance is a good conductor. A conductor having some appreciable resistance is called a resistor. A component of identical size that offers a higher resistance is a poor conductor. An insulator of the same size offers even higher resistance.",

Thus it is obviously impracticable to connect an electric bulb and an electric heater in series, because they need currents of widely different values to operate properly (see Example 11.3). Another major disadvantage of a series circuit is that when one component fails the circuit is broken and none of the components works. If you have used ‘fairy lights’ to decorate buildings on festivals, on marriage celebrations etc., you might have seen the electrician spending lot of time in troublelocating and replacing the ‘dead’ bulb – each has to be tested to find which has fused or gone. On the other hand, a parallel circuit divides the current through the electrical gadgets. The total resistance in a parallel circuit is decreased as per Eq. (11.18). This is helpful particularly when each gadget has different resistance and requires different current to operate properly.",

    "text": "We know that a battery or a cell is a source of electrical energy. The chemical reaction within the cell generates the potential difference between its two terminals that sets the electrons in motion to flow the current through a resistor or a system of resistors connected to the battery. We have also seen, in Section 11.2, that to maintain the current, the source has to keep expending its energy. Where does this energy go? A part of the source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed into useful work (like in rotating the blades of an electric fan). Rest of the source energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature of gadget. We often observe this in our everyday life. For example, an electric fan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other hand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration of resistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually gets dissipated entirely in the form of heat. This is known as the heating effect of electric current. This effect is utilised in devices such as electric heater, electric iron etc.\n\nConsider a current I flowing through a resistor of resistance $R$ . Let the potential difference across it be V (Fig. 11.13). Let $t$ be the time during which a charge $\\boldsymbol { Q }$ flows across. The work done in moving the charge $\\boldsymbol { Q }$ through a potential difference $V$ is $V Q$ . Therefore, the source must supply energy equal to $V Q$ in time t. Hence the power input to the circuit by the source is\n\n$$\nP = V \\frac {Q}{t} = V I \\tag {11.19}\n$$\n\nOr the energy supplied to the circuit by the source in time t is $P \\ \\times \\ t _ { - }$ , that is, VIt. What happens to this energy expended by the source? This energy gets dissipated in the r e s i s t o r a s h e a t . T h u s f o r a s t e a d y current I, the amount of heat $H$ produced in time t is\n\n$$\nH = V I t \\tag {11.20}\n$$\n\nApplying Ohm’s law [Eq. (11.5)], we get\n\n$$\nH = I ^ {2} R t \\tag {11.21}\n$$\n\nThis is known as Joule’s law of heating. The law implies that heat produced in a resistor is (i) directly proportional to the square of current for a given resistance, (ii) directly proportional to resistance for a given current, and (iii) directly proportional to the time for which the current flows through the resistor. In practical situations, when an electric appliance is connected to a known voltage source, Eq. (11.21) is used after calculating the current through it, using the relation $I { = } V / R$ .\n\n![](images/71b21ccce661555554636209e962ff52b48005720c024945a08ce94146c1c4d7.jpg)  \nFigure 11.13   \nA steady current in a purely resistive electric circuit",

Calculate the heat developed in 30 s.\n\n#### 11.7.1 Practical Applications of Heating Effect of Electric Current\n\nThe generation of heat in a conductor is an inevitable consequence of electric current. In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful electrical energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heating can increase the temperature of the components and alter their properties. However, heating effect of electric current has many useful applications. The electric laundry iron, electric toaster, electric oven, electric kettle and electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joule’s heating.\n\nThe electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric bulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is possible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such high temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as tungsten (melting point $3 3 8 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ is used for making bulb filaments. The filament should be thermally isolated as much as possible, using insulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually\n\nfilled with chemically inactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most of the power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part of it is in the form of light radiated.",

    "text": "Another common application of Joule’s heating is the fuse used in electric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow of any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series with the device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of appropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper, iron, lead etc. If a current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit, the temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and breaks the circuit. The fuse wire is usually encased in a cartridge of porcelain or similar material with metal ends. The fuses used for domestic purposes are rated as 1 A, 2 A, 3 A, 5 A, 10 A, etc. For an electric iron which consumes $1 \\mathrm { k W }$ electric power when operated at 220 V, a current of (1000/220) A, that is, 4.54 A will flow in the circuit.

The deflection increases as the needle is moved towards the poles.\n\nMagnetic field is a quantity that has both direction and magnitude. The direction of the magnetic field is taken to be the direction in which a north pole of the compass needle moves inside it. Therefore it is taken by convention that the field lines emerge from north pole and merge at the south pole (note the arrows marked on the field lines in Fig. 12.4).\n\nInside the magnet, the direction of field lines is from its south pole to its north pole. Thus the magnetic field lines are closed curves.\n\nThe relative strength of the magnetic field is shown by the degree of closeness of the field lines. The field is stronger, that is, the force acting on the pole of another magnet placed is greater where the field lines are crowded (see Fig. 12.4).\n\nNo two field-lines are found to cross each other.

If the current flows from north to south, as shown in Fig. 12.5 (a), the north pole of the compass needle would move towards the east.   \n■ Replace the cell connections in the circuit as shown in Fig. 12.5 (b).

Take care that the cardboard is fixed and does not slide up or down.   \n■ Connect the copper wire vertically between the points X and Y, as shown in Fig. 12.6 (a), in series with the battery, a plug and key.   \n■ Sprinkle some iron filings uniformly on the cardboard. (You may use a salt sprinkler for this purpose.)   \n■ Keep the variable of the rheostat at a fixed position and note the current through the ammeter.\n\n■ Close the key so that a current flows through the wire. Ensure that the copper wire placed between the points X and Y remains vertically straight.   \n■ Gently tap the cardboard a few times. Observe the pattern of the iron filings. You would find that the iron filings align themselves showing a pattern of concentric circles around the copper wire (Fig. 12.6).   \n■ What do these concentric circles represent? They represent the magnetic field lines.   \n■ How can the direction of the magnetic field be found? Place a compass at a point (say P) over a circle. Observe the direction of the needle. The direction of the north pole of the compass needle would give the direction of the field lines produced by the electric current through the straight wire at point P. Show the direction by an arrow.   \n■ Does the direction of magnetic field lines get reversed if the direction of current through the straight copper wire is reversed? Check it.\n\nWhat happens to the deflection of the compass needle placed at a given point if the current in the copper wire is changed? To see this, vary the current in the wire. We find that the deflection in the needle also changes. In fact, if the current is increased, the deflection also increases. It indicates that the magnitude of the magnetic field produced at a given point increases as the current through the wire increases.\n\nWhat happens to the deflection of the needle if the compass is moved away from the copper wire but the current through the wire\n\nremains the same? To see this, now place the compass at a farther point from the conducting wire (say at point Q). What change do you observe? We see that the deflection in the needle decreases. Thus the magnetic field produced by a given current in the conductor decreases as the distance from it increases. From Fig. 12.6, it can be noticed that the concentric circles representing the magnetic field around a current-carrying straight wire become larger and larger as we move away from it.",

Why don’t two magnetic field lines intersect each other?\n\n#### 12.2.3 Magnetic Field due to a Current through a Circular Loop\n\nWe have so far observed the pattern of the magnetic field lines produced around a current-carrying straight wire. Suppose this straight wire is bent in the form of a circular loop and a current is passed through it. How would the magnetic field lines look like? We know that the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying straight wire depends inversely on the distance from it. Similarly at every point of a current-carrying circular loop, the concentric circles representing the magnetic field around it would become larger and larger as we move away from the wire (Fig. 12.8). By the time we reach at the centre of the circular loop, the arcs of these big circles would appear as straight lines. Every point on the wire carrying current would give rise to the magnetic field appearing as straight lines at the center of the loop. By applying the right hand rule, it is easy to check that every section of the wire contributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction within the loop.\n\n![](images/8348108c1045cd3d367c3c859e7e9d4f69bc7a74648b36371580df8c93d44795.jpg)  \nFigure 12.8\n\nMagnetic field lines of the field produced by a current-carrying circular loop\n\nWe know that the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire at a given point depends directly on the current passing through it. Therefore, if there is a circular coil having n turns, the field produced is n times as large as that produced by a single turn. This is because the current in each circular turn has the same direction, and the field due to each turn then just adds up.\n\n* This rule is also called Maxwell’s corkscrew rule. If we consider ourselves driving a corkscrew in the direction of the current, then the direction of the rotation of corkscrew is the direction of the magnetic field..",

Do they look similar? Yes, they are similar. In fact, one end of the solenoid behaves as a magnetic north pole, while the other behaves as the south pole. The field lines inside the solenoid are in the form of parallel straight lines. This indicates that the magnetic field is the same at all points inside the solenoid. That is, the field is uniform inside the solenoid.\n\nA strong magnetic field produced inside a solenoid can be used to magnetise a piece of magnetic material, like soft iron, when placed inside the coil (Fig. 12.11). The magnet so formed is called an electromagnet.\n\n![](images/30afa533dcd71552bae1d1abcd97e959d57bb7ceba9cce61674b05531d307331.jpg)  \nFigure 12.11 A current-carrying solenoid coil is used to magnetise steel rod inside it – an electromagnet.\n\n## \n\n1.

Support for the magnet is not shown here, for simplicity.\n\n■ Take a small aluminium rod AB (of about 5 cm). Using two connecting wires suspend it horizontally from a stand, as shown in Fig. 12.12.   \n■ Place a strong horse-shoe magnet in such a way that the rod lies between the two poles with the magnetic field directed upwards. For this put the north pole of the magnet vertically below and south pole vertically above the aluminium rod (Fig. 12.12).   \n■ Connect the aluminium rod in series with a battery, a key and a rheostat.   \n■ Now pass a current through the aluminium rod from end B to end A.   \n■ What do you observe? It is observed that the rod is displaced towards the left. You will notice that the rod gets displaced.   \n■ Reverse the direction of current flowing through the rod and observe the direction of its displacement. It is now towards the right. Why does the rod get displaced?\n\nThe displacement of the rod in the above activity suggests that a force is exerted on the current-carrying aluminium rod when it is placed in a magnetic field. It also suggests that the direction of force is also reversed when the direction of current through the conductor is reversed. Now change the direction of field to vertically downwards by interchanging the two poles of the magnet. It is once again observed that the direction of force acting on the currentcarrying rod gets reversed. It shows that the direction of the force on the conductor depends upon the direction of current and the direction of the magnetic field. Experiments have shown that the displacement of the rod is largest (or the\n\nmagnitude of the force is the highest) when the direction of current is at right angles to the direction of the magnetic field. In such a condition we can use a simple rule to find the direction of the force on the conductor.\n\nIn Activity 12.7, we considered the direction of the current and that of the magnetic field perpendicular to each other and found that the force is perpendicular to both of them. The three directions can be illustrated through a simple rule, called Fleming’s left-hand rule. According to this rule, stretch the thumb, forefinger and middle finger of your left hand such that they are mutually perpendicular (Fig. 12.13). If the first finger points in the direction of magnetic field and the second finger in the direction of current, then the thumb will point in the direction of motion or the force acting on the conductor.\n\n![](images/bffcc4d73d6790447b7ab6ab71a4029526404d48919d8986e6f306724ce11cb6.jpg)  \nFigure 12.13   \nFleming’s left-hand rule\n\nDevices that use current-carrying conductors and magnetic fields include electric motor, electric generator, loudspeakers, microphones and measuring instruments.",

Often, two separate circuits are used, one of 15A current rating for appliances with higher power ratings such as geysers, air coolers, etc. The other circuit is of 5A current rating for bulbs, fans, etc. The earth wire, which has insulation of green colour, is usually connected to a metal plate deep in the earth near the house. This is used as a safety measure, especially for those appliances that have a metallic body, for example, electric press, toaster, table fan, refrigerator, etc. The metallic body is connected to the earth wire, which provides a low-resistance conducting path for the current. Thus, it ensures that any leakage of current to the metallic body of the appliance keeps its potential to that of the earth, and the user may not get a severe electric shock.\n\n![](images/8a2d590da04ac796a352ff0f5fdfd59464d2edee450e7ded9e0d9c4ecdf6cd8a.jpg)  \nFigure 12.15 A schematic diagram of one of the common domestic circuits\n\nFigure 12.15 gives a schematic diagram of one of the common domestic circuits. In each separate circuit, different appliances can be connected across the live and neutral wires. Each appliance has a separate switch to ‘ON’/‘OFF’ the flow of current through it. In order that each appliance has equal potential difference, they are connected parallel to each other.\n\nElectric fuse is an important component of all domestic circuits. We have already studied the principle and working of a fuse in the previous chapter (see Section 11.7). A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the appliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur when the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. (This occurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the appliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly increases. This is called short-circuiting. The use of an electric fuse prevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage by stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating that takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit. Overloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply voltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many appliances to a single socket.\n\n##",

    "text": "■ A compass needle is a small magnet. Its one end, which points towards north, is called a north pole, and the other end, which points towards south, is called a south pole.   \n■ A magnetic field exists in the region surrounding a magnet, in which the force of the magnet can be detected.   \n■ Field lines are used to represent a magnetic field. A field line is the path along which a hypothetical free north pole would tend to move. The direction of the magnetic field at a point is given by the direction that a north pole placed at that point would take. Field lines are shown closer together where the magnetic field is greater.   \n■ A metallic wire carrying an electric current has associated with it a magnetic field. The field lines about the wire consist of a series of concentric circles whose direction is given by the right-hand rule.   \n■ The pattern of the magnetic field around a conductor due to an electric current flowing through it depends on the shape of the conductor. The magnetic field of a solenoid carrying a current is similar to that of a bar magnet.   \n■ An electromagnet consists of a core of soft iron wrapped around with a coil of insulated copper wire.\n\n■ A current-carrying conductor when placed in a magnetic field experiences a force. If the direction of the field and that of the current are mutually perpendicular to each other, then the force acting on the conductor will be perpendicular to both and will be given by Fleming’s left-hand rule.   \n■ In our houses we receive AC electric power of $2 2 0 \\mathrm { V }$ with a frequency of $5 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ . One of the wires in this supply is with red insulation, called live wire. The other one is of black insulation, which is a neutral wire. The potential difference between the two is $2 2 0 \\mathrm { V } .$ The third is the earth wire that has green insulation and this is connected to a metallic body deep inside earth. It is used as a safety measure to ensure that any leakage of current to a metallic body does not give any severe shock to a user.   \n■ Fuse is the most important safety device, used for protecting the circuits due to shortcircuiting or overloading of the circuits.",

In this and the next two chapters, we carry this idea of power-sharing forward. We start with two stories from Belgium and Sri Lanka. Both these stories are about how democracies handle demands for power-sharing. The stories yield some general conclusions about the need for power-sharing in democracy. This allows us to discuss various forms of power-sharing that will be taken up in the following two chapters.\n\nChapter I\n\nI have a simple equation in mind.

    "text": "Belgium is a small country in Europe, smaller in area than the state of Haryana. It has borders with France, the Netherlands, Germany and Luxembourg. It has a population of a little over one crore, about half the population of Haryana. The ETHNIC composition of this small country is very complex. Of the country’s total population, 59 per cent lives in the Flemish region and speaks Dutch language. Another 40 per cent people live in the Wallonia region and speak French. Remaining one per cent of the Belgians speak German. In the capital city Brussels, 80 per cent people speak French while 20 per cent are Dutch-speaking.\n\nThe minority French-speaking community was relatively rich and powerful. This was resented by the Dutch-speaking community who got the benefi t of economic development and education much later. This led to\n\ntensions between the Dutch-speaking and French-speaking communities during the 1950s and 1960s. The tension between the two communities was more acute in Brussels. Brussels presented a special problem: the Dutch-speaking people constituted a majority in the country, but a minority in the capital.\n\nLet us compare this to the situation in another country. Sri Lanka is an island nation, just a few kilometres off the southern coast of Tamil Nadu. It has about two crore people, about the same as in Haryana. Like other nations in the South Asia region, Sri Lanka has a diverse population. The major social groups are the Sinhala-speakers (74 per cent) and the Tamil-speakers (18 per cent). Among Tamils there are two subgroups. Tamil natives of the country are called ‘Sri Lankan Tamils’ (13 per cent). The rest, whose forefathers came from India as plantation workers during\n\n![](images/44ad33f04543be774ef90316d6000242a8dbca2c292b5e588e20a08ce32d76be.jpg)\n\nLook at the maps of Belgium and Sri Lanka. In which region, do you fi nd concentration of different communities?\n\nFor more details, visit https://www.belgium.be/en\n\ncolonial period, are called ‘Indian Tamils’. As you can see from the map, Sri Lankan Tamils are concentrated in the north and east of the country. Most of the Sinhala-speaking people are Buddhists, while most of the Tamils are Hindus or Muslims. There are about 7 per cent Christians, who are both Tamil and Sinhala.\n\nJust imagine what could happen in situations like this. In Belgium, the Dutch community could take advantage of its numeric majority and force its will on the French and German-\n\nspeaking population. This would push the confl ict among communities further. This could lead to a very messy partition of the country; both the sides would claim control over Brussels. In Sri Lanka, the Sinhala community enjoyed an even bigger majority and could impose its will on the entire country. Now, let us look at what happened in both these countries.",

    "text": "Sri Lanka emerged as an independent country in 1948. The leaders of the Sinhala community sought to secure dominance over government by virtue of their majority. As a result, the democratically elected government adopted a series of M AJORITARIAN measures to establish Sinhala supremacy.\n\nIn 1956, an Act was passed to recognise Sinhala as the only offi cial language, thus disregarding Tamil. The governments followed preferential policies that favoured Sinhala applicants for university positions and government jobs. A new constitution stipulated that the state shall protect and foster Buddhism.\n\nAll these government measures, coming one after the other, gradually increased the feeling of alienation among the Sri Lankan Tamils. They felt that none of the major political parties led by the Buddhist Sinhala leaders was sensitive to their language and culture. They felt that the constitution\n\nand government policies denied them equal political rights, discriminated against them in getting jobs and other opportunities and ignored their interests. As a result, the relations\n\n![](images/1b58254b7f1d50b3b61f8895a089929a321f3b7926e7c0b4a9d5f22f65dd1b85.jpg)\n\n\nMajoritarianism: A belief that the majority community should be able to rule a country in whichever way it wants, by disregarding the wishes and needs of the minority.\n\nWhat’s wrong if the majority community rules? If Sinhalas don’t rule in Sri Lanka, where else will they rule?\n\n![](images/6d0409e52f3647dfa6fad37f86f5c9da3e641dc39052e1f63711d22e395f54b1.jpg)\n\nbetween the Sinhala and Tamil communities strained over time.\n\nThe Sri Lankan Tamils launched parties and struggles for the recognition of Tamil as an offi cial language, for regional autonomy and equality of opportunity in securing education and jobs. But their demand for more autonomy to provinces populated by the Tamils was repeatedly denied. By 1980s, several political organisations were formed demanding an independent Tamil Eelam (state) in northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka.\n\nThe distrust between the two\n\ncommunities turned into widespread confl ict. It soon turned into a CIVIL WAR. As a result thousands of people of both the communities have been killed. Many families were forced to leave the country as refugees and many more lost their livelihoods. You have read (Chapter 1 of Economics textbook, Class X) about Sri Lanka’s excellent record of economic development, education and health. But the civil war has caused a terrible setback to the social, cultural and economic life of the country. It ended in 2009.\n\n\nCivil war: A violent confl ict between opposing groups within a country that becomes so intense that it appears like a war.",

    "text": "The Belgian leaders took a different path. They recognised the existence of regional differences and cultural diversities. Between 1970 and 1993, they amended their constitution four times so as to work out an arrangement that would enable everyone to live together within the same country. The arrangement they worked out is different from any other country and is very innovative. Here are some of the elements of the Belgian model:\n\n Constitution prescribes that the number of Dutch and Frenchspeaking ministers shall be equal in the central government. Some special laws require the support of majority of members from each linguistic\n\ngroup. Thus, no single community can make decisions unilaterally.\n\nMany powers of the Central Government have been given to State Governments of the two regions of the country. The State Governments are not subordinate to the Central Government.   \nBrussels has a separate government in which both the communities have equal representation. The Frenchspeaking people accepted equal representation in Brussels because the Dutch-speaking community has\n\n![](images/e8a8a47e45ad55abfea1d9ae4bc4ea29d1a018e676a5c8929ea51afd66dcc9b7.jpg)\n\nThe photograph here is of a street address in Belgium. You will notice that place names and directions in two languages – French and Dutch.\n\nWhat kind of a solution is this? I am glad our Constitution does not say which minister will come from which community.\n\naccepted equal representation in the Central Government.\n\n$\\bullet$ Apart from the Central and the State Government, there is a third kind of government. This ‘community government’ is elected by people belonging to one language community – Dutch, French and German-speaking – no matter where they live. This government has the power regarding cultural, educational and language-related issues.\n\nYou might fi nd the Belgian model very complicated. It indeed is very complicated, even for people living in Belgium. But these arrangements have worked well so far. They helped to avoid civic strife between the two major communities and a possible division of the country on linguistic lines. When many countries of\n\n![](images/7860f93fec73c750bc845ec1260f0c04c8518d08465e0d118c2124199075773a.jpg)  \nEuropean Parliament in Brussels, Belgium\n\nEurope came together to form the European Union, Brussels was chosen as its headquarters.\n\nSo you are saying that sharing of power makes us more powerful. Sounds odd! Let me think.\n\n![](images/f6ec6dea621394730ac240c1a569b2cd00c346761551ef26171eab87d0d9d063.jpg)\n\nRead any newspaper for one week and make clippings of news related to ongoing confl icts or wars. A group of fi ve students could pool their clippings together and do the owing:\n\nClassify these confl icts by their location (your state, India, outside India).   \n Find out the cause of each of these confl icts. How many of these are related to power sharing disputes?   \n Which of these confl icts could be resolved by working out power sharing arrangements?\n\nWhat do we learn from these two stories of Belgium and Sri Lanka? Both are democracies. Yet, they dealt with the question of power sharing differently. In Belgium, the leaders have realised that the unity of the country is possible only by respecting the feelings and interests of different communities",

It shows us that if a majority community wants to force its dominance over others and refuses to share power, it can undermine the unity of the country.\n\n![](images/daf22500c24190304bcb51a55c507571a7e9ba33177f7107bec60ced15e1068c.jpg)\n\nThe cartoon at the left refers to the problems of running the Germany’s grand coalition government that includes the two major parties of the country, namely the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party. The two parties are historically rivals to each other. They had to form a coalition government because neither of them got clear majority of seats on their own in the 2005 elections. They take divergent positions on several policy matters, but still jointly run the government. For details about the German Parliament, visit https://www.bundestag.de/en\n\nTyranny of the majority is not just oppressive for the minority; it often brings ruin to the majority as well.\n\nThere is a second, deeper reason why power sharing is g ood for democracies. Power sharing is the very spirit of democracy. A democratic rule involves sharing power with those affected by its exercise, and who have to live with its effects. People have a right to be consulted on how they are to be governed. A legitimate government is one where citizens, through participation, acquire a stake in the system.\n\nLet us call the fi rst set of reasons PRUDENTIAL and the second moral. While prudential reasons stress that power sharing will bring out better outcomes, moral reasons emphasise the very act of power sharing as valuable.\n\nPrudential: Based on prudence, or on careful calculation of gains and losses. Prudential decisions are usually contrasted with decisions based purely on moral considerations.\n\ne Annette studies in a Dutch medium school in the northern region of Belgium.

This time the story went as follows:\n\n“In the city of Beirut, there lived a man called Khalil. His parents came from diff erent communities. His father was an Orthodox Christian and mother a Sunni Muslim. This was not so uncommon in this modern, cosmopolitan city. People from various communities that lived in Lebanon came to live in its capital, Beirut. They lived together, intermingled, yet fought a bitter civil war among themselves. One of Khalil’s uncles was killed in that war.\n\nAt the end of this civil war, Lebanon’s leaders came together and agreed to some basic rules for power sharing among diff erent communities. As per these rules, the country’s President must belong to the Maronite sect of Catholic Christians. The Prime Minister must be from the Sunni Muslim community. The post of Deputy Prime Minister is fi xed for Orthodox Christian sect and that of the Speaker for Shi’a Muslims. Under this pact, the Christians agreed not to seek French protection and the Muslims agreed not to seek unifi cation with the neighbouring state of Syria.When the Christians and Muslims came to this agreement, they were nearly equal in population. Both sides have continued to respect this agreement though now the Muslims are in clear majority.\n\nKhalil does not like this system one bit. He is a popular man with political ambition. But under the present system, the top position is out of his reach. He does not practise either his father’s or his mother’s religion and does not wish to be known by either. He cannot understand why Lebanon can’t be like any other ‘normal’ democracy. “Just hold an election, allow everyone to contest and whoever wins maximum votes becomes the president, no matter which community he comes from. Why can’t we do that, like in other democracies of the world?” he asks. His elders, who have seen the bloodshed of the civil war, tell him that the present system is the best guarantee for peace…”\n\nThe story was not fi nished, but they had reached the TV tower where they stopped every day. Vetal wrapped up quickly and posed his customary question to Vikram: “If\n\nyou had the power to rewrite the rules in Lebanon, what would you do? Would you adopt the ‘regular’ rules followed everywhere, as Khalil suggests? Or stick to the old rules? Or do something else?” Vetal did not forget to remind Vikram of their basic pact: “If you have an answer in mind and yet do not speak up, your mobike will freeze, and so will you!”\n\nCan you help poor Vikram in answering Vet\n\n![](images/aae1252e331c34cc32b0394e287fddb8b710dbb254c1aaae32fce3cf71d32889.jpg)",

For a long time, it was believed that all power of a government must reside in one person or group of persons located at one place. It was felt that if the power to decide is dispersed, it would not be possible to take quick decisions and to enforce them. But these notions have changed with the emergence of democracy. One basic principle of democracy is that people are the source of all political power. In a democracy, people rule themselves through institutions of self-government. In a good democratic government, due respect is given to diverse groups and views that exist in a society. Everyone has a voice in the shaping of public policies.

During the same time, the US president visited Russia. What, according to this cartoon, is the relationship between democracy and concentration of power? Can you think of some other examples to illustrate the point being made here?\n\npower should be distributed among as many citizens as possible.\n\nIn modern democracies, power sharing arrangements can take many forms. Let us look at some of the most common arrangements that we have or will come across.\n\n1 Power is shared among different organs of government, such as the legislature, executive and judiciary. Let us call this horizontal distribution of power because it allows different organs of government placed at the same level to exercise different powers. Such a separation ensures that none of the organs can exercise unlimited power. Each organ checks the others. This results in a balance of power among various institutions. Last year, we studied that in a democracy, even though ministers and government officials exercise power, they are responsible to the Parliament or State Assemblies. Similarly, although judges are appointed by the executive, they can check the functioning of executive or laws made by the legislatures. This arrangement is called a system of checks and balances.\n\n2 Power can be shared among governments at different levels – a general government for the entire country and governments at the provincial or regional level. Such a general government for the entire country is usually called federal government. In India, we refer to it as the Central or Union Government. The governments at the provincial or regional level are called by different names in different countries.\n\nI n I n d i a , w e c a l l t h e m S t a t e Governments. This system is not followed in all countries. There are many countries where there are no provincial or state governments. But in those countries like ours, where there are different levels of government, the constitution clearly lays down the powers of different levels of government. This is what they did in Belgium, but was refused in Sri Lanka. This is called federal division of power. The same principle can be extended to levels of government lower than the State government, such as the municipality and panchayat. Let us call division of powers involving higher and lower levels of government vertical division of power. We shall study these at some length in the next chapter.\n\n3 Power may also be shared among different social groups, such as the religious and linguistic groups. ‘Community government’ in Belgium is a good example of this arrangement. In some countries, there are constitutional and legal arrangements, whereby socially weaker sections and women are represented in the legislatures and administration. Last year, we studied the system of ‘reserved constituencies’ in assemblies and the parliament of our country. This type of arrangement is meant to give space in the government and administration to diverse social",

In Unit II, we shall look at various ways of accommodating social diversities.\n\n4 Power sharing arrangements can also be seen in the way political parties, pressure groups and movements control or infl uence those in power. In a democracy, the citizens must have freedom to choose among various contenders for power. In contemporary democracies, this takes the form of competition among different parties. Such competition ensures that power does not remain in one hand. In the long run, power is shared among different political parties that represent different ideologies and social groups. Sometimes this kind of sharing can be direct, when two or more parties form an alliance to contest elections. If their alliance is elected, they form a coalition government and thus share power. In a democracy, we fi nd interest groups, such as those of traders, businessmen, industrialists, farmers and industrial workers. They also will have a share in governmental power, either through participation in governmental committees or bringing infl uence on the decision-making process. In Unit III, we shall study the working of political parties.\n\nIn my school, the class monitor changes every month.

The Minister responsible for Native Aff airs announced that the government will work with aboriginal people in a spirit of mutual respect and cooperation.   \n Russia’s two infl uential political parties, the Union of Right Forces and the Liberal Yabloko Movement, agreed to unite their organisations into a strong rightwing coalition.

Give your reasons in about 50 words.\n\nThomman - Power sharing is necessary only in societies which have religious, linguistic or ethnic divisions.\n\nMathayi – Power sharing is suitable only for big countries that have regional divisions.\n\nOuseph – Every society needs some form of power sharing even if it is small or does not have social divisions.\n\n4. The Mayor of Merchtem, a town near Brussels in Belgium, has defended a ban on speaking French in the town’s schools. He said that the ban would help all non-Dutch speakers integrate in this Flemish town. Do you think that this measure is in keeping with the spirit of Belgium’s power sharing arrangements? Give your reasons in about 50 words.\n\n5. Read the following passage and pick out any one of the prudential reasons for power sharing off ered in this.\n\n“We need to give more power to the panchayats to realise the dream of Mahatma Gandhi and the hopes of the makers of our Constitution. Panchayati Raj establishes true democracy. It restores power to the only place where power belongs in a democracy – in the hands of the people. Giving power to Panchayats is also a way to reduce corruption and increase administrative effi ciency. When people participate in the planning and implementation of developmental schemes, they would naturally exercise greater control over these schemes. This would eliminate the corrupt middlemen. Thus, Panchayati Raj will strengthen the foundations of our democracy.”\n\n6. Diff erent arguments are usually put forth in favour of and against power sharing. Identify those which are in favour of power sharing and select the answer using the codes given below? Power sharing:\n\nA. reduces confl ict among diff erent communities   \nB. decreases the possibility of arbitrariness   \nC. delays decision making process   \nD. accommodates diversities   \nE. increases instability and divisiveness   \nF. promotes people’s participation in government   \nG. undermines the unity of a country\n\n<table><tr><td>(a)</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>D</td><td>F</td></tr><tr><td>(b)</td><td>A</td><td>C</td><td>E</td><td>F</td></tr><tr><td>(c)</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>D</td><td>G</td></tr><tr><td>(d)</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>G</td></tr></table>\n\n7. Consider the following statements about power sharing arrangements in Belgium and Sri Lanka.\n\nA. In Belgium, the Dutch-speaking majority people tried to impose their domination on the minority French-speaking community.   \nB. In Sri Lanka, the policies of the government sought to ensure the dominance of the Sinhala-speaking majority.   \nC. The Tamils in Sri Lanka demanded a federal arrangement of power sharing to protect their culture, language and equality of opportunity in education and jobs.   \nD. The transformation of Belgium from unitary government to a federal one prevented a possible division of the country on linguistic lines.\n\nWhich of the statements given above are correct?\n\n(a) A, B, C and D (b) A, B and D (c) C and D (d) B, C and D",

In this chapter, we focus on this form of powersharing. It is most commonly referred to as federalism. We begin by describing federalism in general terms. The rest of the chapter tries to understand the theory and practice of federalism in India. A discussion of the federal constitutional provisions is followed by an analysis of the policies and politics that has strengthened federalism in practice. Towards the end of the chapter, we turn to the local government, a new and third tier of Indian federalism.\n\n\n![](images/812f851fb40a9ecc550253409e91f7355f6f6059ee3cc7a000c6304202579138.jpg)\n\nI am confused.

    "text": "Let us get back to the contrast between Belgium and Sri Lanka that we saw in the last chapter. You would recall that one of the key changes made in the Constitution of Belgium was to reduce the power of the Central Government and to give these powers to the regional governments. Regional governments existed in Belgium even earlier. They had their roles and powers. But all these powers were given to these governments and could be withdrawn by the Central Government. The change that took place in 1993 was that the regional governments were given constitutional powers that were no longer dependent on the central government. Thus, Belgium shifted from a unitary to a federal form of government. Sri Lanka continues\n\nto be, for all practical purposes, a unitary system where the national government has all the powers. Tamil leaders want Sri Lanka to become a federal system.\n\nFederalism is a system of government in which the power is divided between a central authority and various constituent units of the country. Usually, a federation has two levels of government. One is the government for the entire country that is usually responsible for a few subjects of common national interest. The others are governments at the level of provinces or states that look after much of the dayto-day administering of their state. Both these levels of governments enjoy their power independent of the other.\n\n![](images/a7ae9b7e5b610c18bd5c38a55591ff7f7369b1d0a20a4897799faffba7ddd7f2.jpg)  \nThough only 25 of the world’s 193 countries have federal political systems, their citizens make up 40 per cent of the world’s population. Most of the large countries of the world are federations. Can you notice an exception to this rule in this map?\n\nIn this sense, federations are contrasted with unitary governments. Under the unitary system, either there is only one level of government or the sub-units are subordinate to the central government. The central government can pass on orders to the provincial or the local government. But in a federal system, the central government cannot order the state government to do something. State government has powers of its own for which it is not answerable to the central government. Both these governments are separately answerable to the people.\n\nLet us look at some of the key features of federalism :",

    "text": "1 There are two or more levels (or tiers) of government.   \n2 Different tiers of government govern the same citizens, but each tier has its own JURISDICTION in specifi c matters of legislation, taxation and administration.   \n3 The jurisdictions of the respective levels or tiers of government are specifi ed in the constitution. So the existence and authority of each tier of government is constitutionally guaranteed.   \n4 The fundamental provisions of the constitution cannot be unilaterally changed by one level of government. Such changes require the consent of both the levels of government.   \n5 Courts have the power to interpret the constitution and the powers of different levels of government. The highest court acts as an umpire if disputes arise between different levels of government in the exercise of their respective powers.   \n6 Sources of revenue for each level of government are clearly specifi ed to ensure its fi nancial autonomy.\n\n7 The federal system thus has dual objectives: to safeguard and promote unity of the country, while at the same time accommodate regional diversity. Therefore, two aspects are crucial for the institutions and practice of federalism. Governments at different levels should agree to some rules of power-sharing. They should also trust that each would abide by its part of the agreement. An ideal federal system has both aspects : mutual trust and agreement to live together.\n\nThe exact balance of power between the central and the state government varies from one federation to another. This balance depends mainly on the historical context in which the federation was formed. There are two kinds of routes through which federations have been formed. The fi rst route involves independent States coming together on their own to form a bigger unit, so that by pooling sovereignty and retaining identity, they can increase their security. This type of ‘coming together’ federations include the USA, Switzerland and Australia. In this fi rst category of federations, all the constituent States usually have equal power and are strong vis-à-vis the federal government.\n\nThe second route is where a large country decides to divide its power between the constituent States and the national government. India, Spain and Belgium are examples of this kind of ‘holding together’ federations. In this second category, the Central Government tends to be more powerful vis-à-vis the States. Very often different constituent units of the federation have unequal powers. Some units are granted special powers.\n\n![](images/6a27ebc1c1ab49867a36b1e8838f13b3ca6f1e515787e4c47984d4c55d5aab8d.jpg)\n\nIf federalism works only in big countries, why did Belgium adopt it?",

    "text": "We have earlier seen how small countries like Belgium and Sri Lanka face so many problems of managing diversity. What about a vast country like India, with so many languages, religions and regions? What are the power sharing arrangements in our country?\n\nLet us begin with the Constitution. India had emerged as an independent nation after a painful and bloody partition. Soon after Independence, several princely states became a part of the country. The Constitution declared India as a Union of States. Although it did not use the word federation, the Indian Union is based on the principles of federalism.\n\nLet us go back to the seven features of federalism mentioned above. We can see that all these features apply to the provisions of the Indian Constitution. The Constitution originally provided for a two-tier system of government, the Union Government or what we call the Central Government, representing the Union of India and the State governments. Later, a third tier of federalism was added\n\nin the form of Panchayats and Municipalities. As in any federation, these different tiers enjoy separate jurisdiction. The Constitution clearly provided a three-fold distribution of legislative powers between the Union Government and the State Governments. Thus, it contains three lists:\n\nUnion List includes subjects of national importance, such as defence of the country, foreign affairs, banking, communications and currency. They are included in this list because we need a uniform policy on these matters throughout the country. The Union Government alone can make laws relating to the subjects mentioned in the Union List.   \nState List contains subjects of State and local importance, such as police, trade, commerce, agriculture and irrigation. The State Governments alone can make laws relating to the subjects mentioned in the State List.   \n Concurrent List includes subjects of common interest to both the Union Government as well as the State Governments, such as\n\nIsn’t that strange? Did our constitution makers not know about federalism? Or did they wish to avoid talking about it?\n\n![](images/8df2cab51c52e9ebf8973c2641552960ea0a9b7d0660fd8d000881910ceb59ec.jpg)\n\neducation, forest, trade unions, marriage, adoption and succession. Both the Union as well as the State Governments can make laws on the subjects mentioned in this list. If their laws conflict with each other, the law made by the Union Government will prevail.\n\nWhat about subjects that do not fall in any of the three lists? Or subjects like computer software that came up after the constitution was made? According to our constitution, the Union Government has the power to legislate on these ‘residuary’ subjects.",

    "text": "We noted above that most federations that are formed by ‘holding together’ do not give equal power to its constituent units. Thus, all States in the Indian Union do not have identical powers. Some States enjoy a special status. States such as Assam, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram enjoy special powers under certain provisions of the Constitution of India (Article 371) due to their peculiar social and historical circumstances. These special powers are especially enjoyed in relation to the protection of land rights of indigenous peoples, their culture and also preferential employment in government services. Indians who are not permanent residents of this State cannot buy land or house here. Similar special provisions exist for some other States of India as well.\n\nThere are some units of the Indian Union which enjoy very little power. These are areas which are too small to become an independent State but which could not be merged with any of the existing States. These areas, like Chandigarh, or Lakshadweep or the capital city of Delhi, are called Union Territories. These territories do not have the powers of a State. The Central Government has special powers in running these areas.\n\nThis sharing of power between the Union Government and the State Governments is basic to the structure of the Constitution. It is not easy to make changes to this power sharing arrangement. The Parliament cannot on its own change this arrangement. Any change to it has to be first passed by both the Houses of Parliament with at least two-thirds majority. Then it has to be ratified by the legislatures of at least half of the total States.\n\nThe judiciary plays an important role in overseeing the implementation of constitutional provisions and procedures. In case of any dispute about the division of powers, the High Courts and the Supreme Court make a decision. The Union and State Governments have the power to raise resources by levying taxes in order to carry on the government and the responsibilities assigned to each of them.\n\nIf agriculture and commerce are state subjects, why do we have ministers of agriculture and commerce in the Union cabinet?\n\n![](images/4b411b220b948a7593a64748008c2dfa70b1bf5dc27e4e9ba54f0824e2f7c9a1.jpg)\n\nListen to one national and one regional news bulletin broadcast by All India Radio daily for one week.

Many old States have vanished and many new States have been created. Areas, boundaries and names of the States have been changed.\n\nIn 1947, the boundaries of several old States of India were changed in order to create new States. This was done to ensure that people who spoke the same language lived in the same State. Some States were created not on the basis of language but to recognise differences based on culture, ethnicity or geography. These include States like Nagaland, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand.\n\n![](images/9d3f3b595c764b75a3be6a34a236a53f1ca78732f716e502d1d9738a4896e77b.jpg)\n\n Has your village / town / city remained under the same State since Independence?

Hindi was identifi ed as the offi cial language. But Hindi is the mother tongue of only about 40 per cent of Indians. Therefore, there were many safeguards to protect other languages. Besides Hindi, there are 21 other languages recognised as Scheduled Languages by the Constitution. A candidate in an examination conducted for the Central Government positions may opt to take the examination in any of these languages. States too have their own offi cial languages. Much of the government work takes place in the offi cial language of the concerned State.\n\nUnlike Sri Lanka, the leaders of our country adopted a very cautious attitude in spreading the use of Hindi. According to the Constitution, the use of English for offi cial purposes was to stop in 1965. However, many non-Hindi speaking States demanded that the use of English continue. In Tamil Nadu, this movement took a violent form. The Central Government responded by agreeing to continue the use of English along with Hindi for offi cial purposes. Many critics\n\nthink that this solution favoured the English-speaking elite. Promotion of Hindi continues to be the offi cial policy of the Government of India. Promotion does not mean that the Central Government can impose Hindi on States where people speak a different language. The fl exibility shown by Indian political leaders helped our country avoid the kind of situation that Sri Lanka fi nds itself in.",

How the constitutional arrangements for sharing power work in reality depends to a large extent on how the ruling parties and leaders follow these arrangements. For a long time, the same party ruled both at the Centre and in most of the States. This meant that the State Governments did not exercise their rights as autonomous federal units. As and when the ruling party at the State level was different, the parties that ruled at the Centre tried to undermine the power of the States. In those days, the Central Government would often misuse the Constitution to dismiss the State Governments that were controlled by rival parties. This undermined the spirit of federalism.\n\nAll this changed signifi cantly after 1990. This period saw the rise of regional political parties in many States of the country. This was also the beginning of the era of COALITION GOVERNM ENTS at the Centre. Since no single party got a clear majority in the Lok Sabha, the major national parties had to enter into an alliance with many parties including several regional parties to form a government at the Centre.",

This census recorded more than 1300 distinct languages which people mentioned as their mother tongues. These languages were grouped together under some major languages. For example, languages like Bhojpuri, Magadhi, Bundelkhandi, Chhattisgarhi, Rajasthani and many others were grouped together under ‘Hindi’. Even after this grouping, the Census found 121 major languages. Of these, 22 languages are now included in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution and are therefore called ‘Scheduled Languages’. Others are called ‘non-Scheduled Languages’. In terms of languages, India is perhaps the most diverse country in the world.\n\nA look at the enclosed table makes it clear that no one language is the mother tongue of the majority of our population. The largest language, Hindi, is the mother tongue of only about 44 per cent Indians. If we add to that all those who knew Hindi as their second or third language, the total number was still less than 50 per cent in 2011. As for English, only 0.02 per cent Indians recorded it as their mother tongue. Another 11 per cent knew it as a second or third language.\n\nRead this table carefully, but you need not memorise it.

I always prefer the lower berth!\n\nWe noted above that federal governments have two or more tiers of governments. We have so far discussed the two-tiers of government in our country. But a vast country like India cannot b e r u n o n l y t h r o u g h t h e s e two-tiers. States in India are as large as independent countries of Europe. In terms of population, Uttar Pradesh is bigger than Russia, Maharashtra is about as big as Germany. Many of these States are internally very diverse. There is thus a need for power sharing within these States. Federal power sharing in India needs another tier of government, below that of the State governments. This is the rationale for decentralisation of power. Thus, resulted a thirdtier of government, called local government.\n\nWhen power is taken away from Central and State governments and given to local government, it is called decentralisation. The basic idea behind decentralisation is that there are a large number of problems and issues which are best settled at the local level. People have better knowledge of problems in their localities. They also have better ideas on where to spend money and how to manage things more effi ciently. Besides, at the local level it is possible for the people to directly participate in decision making. This helps to inculcate a habit of democratic participation. Local government is the best way to realise one important principle of democracy, namely local self-government.\n\nThe need for decentralisation was recognised in our Constitution. Since then, there have been several attempts to decentralise\n\npower to the level of villages and towns. Panchayats in villages and municipalities in urban areas were set up in all the States. But these were directly under the control of state governments. Elections to these local governments were not held regularly. Local governments did not have any powers or resources of their own. Thus, there was very little decentralisation in effective terms.\n\nA major step towards decentralisation was taken in 1992. The Constitution was amended to make the third-tier of democracy more powerful and effective.\n\nNow it is constitutionally mandatory to hold regular elections to local government bodies.   \nSeats are reserved in the elected bodies and the executive heads of these institutions for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.   \nAt least one-third of all positions are reserved for women.   \nAn independent institution called the State Election Commission has been created in each State to conduct panchayat and municipal elections.   \nThe State governments are required to share some powers and revenue with local government bodies. The nature of sharing varies from State to State.\n\nRural local government is popularly known by the name panchayati raj. Each village, or a group of villages in some States, has a gram panchayat. This is a council consisting of several ward members, often called panch, and a president or sarpanch. They are directly",

    "text": "A city called Porto Alegre in Brazil has carried out an extraordinary experiment in combining decentralisation with participative democracy. The city has set up a parallel organisation operating alongside the municipal council, enabling local inhabitants to take real decisions for their city. The nearly 13 lakh people in this city get to participate in making the budget for their own city. The city is divided into many sectors or what we call wards. Each sector has a meeting, like that of the gram sabha, in which anyone living in that area can participate. There are some meetings to discuss issues that aff ect the entire city. Any citizen of the city can participate in those meetings. The budget of the city is discussed in these meetings. The proposals are put to the municipality that takes a fi nal decision about it.\n\nAbout 20,000 people participate in this decision making exercise every year. This method has ensured that the money cannot be spent only for the benefi t of the colonies where rich people live. Buses now run to the poor colonies and builders cannot evict slum-dwellers without resettling them.\n\nIn our own country, a similar experiment has taken place in some areas in Kerala. Ordinary people have participated in making a plan for the development of their locality.\n\nT h i s n e w s y s t e m o f l o c a l government is the largest experiment in democracy conducted anywhere in the world. There are now about 36 lakh elected representatives in the panchayats and municipalities etc., all over the country. This number is bigger than the population of many countries in the world. Constitutional status for local government has helped to deepen democracy in our country. It has also\n\nincreased women’s representation and voice in our democracy. At the same time, there are many difficulties. While elections are held regularly and enthusiastically, gram sabhas are not held regularly. Most state governments have not transferred signifi cant powers to the local governments. Nor have they given adequate resources. We are thus still a long way from realising the ideal of self-government.\n\n![](images/c2b54f3a264fb77e7de5c9d0aa9a4839b46b2249a81b28a246dffe8f047f2a08.jpg)\n\nFind out about the local government in the village or town you live in.\n\nIf you live in a village, fi nd out the names of the following: your panch or ward member, your sarpanch, your panchayat samiti, the chairperson of your zilla parishad. Also fi nd out when did the last meeting of the gram sabha take place and how many people took part in that.\n\nIf you live in urban areas, fi nd out the name of your municipal councillor, and the municipal chairperson or mayor.

Give an argument and an example to support any of these positions.\n\nSangeeta: The policy of accommodation has strengthened national unity.\n\nArman: Language-based States have divided us by making everyone conscious of their language.\n\nHarish: This policy has only helped to consolidate the dominance of English over all other languages.\n\n8.

    "text": "Boys and girls are brought up to believe that the main responsibility of women is housework and bringing up children. This is refl ected in a SEXUAL DIVISION OF LAB OUR in most families: women do all work inside the home such as cooking, cleaning, washing clothes, tailoring, looking after children, etc., and men do all the work outside the home. It is not that men cannot do housework; they simply think that it is for women to attend to these things. When these jobs are paid for, men are ready to take up these works. Most tailors or cooks in hotels are men. Similarly, it is not that women do not work outside their home. In villages, women fetch water, collect fuel and work in the fi elds. In urban areas, poor women work as domestic helper in middle class homes, while middle class women work in offi ces. In fact, the majority of women do some sort of paid work in addition to domestic labour. But their work is not valued and does not get recognition.\n\nThe result of this division of labour is that although women constitute half of the humanity, their role in public life, especially politics, is minimal in most societies. Earlier, only men were allowed to participate in public affairs, vote and contest for public offices. Gradually the gender issue was raised in politics. Women in different parts of the world organised and agitated for equal rights. There were agitations in different countries for the extension of voting rights to women.\n\nT h e s e a g i t a t i o n s d e m a n d e d enhancing the political and legal status of women and improving their educational and career opportunities. More radical women’s movements aimed at equality in personal and family life as well. These movements are called FEM INIST movements.\n\nPolitical expression of gender division and political mobilisation\n\non this question helped to improve women’s role in public life. We now fi nd women working as scientists, d o c t o r s , e n g i n e e r s , l a w y e r s , managers and college and university teachers which were earlier not considered suitable for women.

Women also do a lot of direct income generating work, but the bulk of their work is household related.

If necessary make new categories. Add up the time taken on each activity for a week and calculate the daily average for each activity for each member. Do women work more in your family as well?\n\nlook at school results, girls perform as well as boys, if not better in some places. But they drop out because parents prefer to spend their resources for their boys’ education rather than spending equally on their sons and daughters.\n\n No wonder the proportion of women among the highly paid and valued jobs, is still very small. On an average, an Indian woman works one hour more than an average man every day. Yet much of her work is not paid and therefore, often not valued.\n\n The Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 provides that equal wages should be paid to equal work. However in almost all areas of work, from sports and cinema, to factories and fi elds, women are paid less than men, even when both do exactly the same work.   \n In many parts of India, parents prefer to have sons and fi nd ways to have the girl child aborted before she is born.

This has led many feminists and women’s movements to the conclusion that unless women control power, their problems will not get adequate attention. One way to ensure this is to have more women as elected representatives.\n\nIn India, the proportion of women in legislature has been very low. For example, the percentage of elected women members in Lok Sabha has touched 14.36 per cent of its total strength for the fi rst time in 2019. Their share in the state assemblies is less than 5 per cent. In this respect, India is among the\n\nCould you think of some reasons why women’s representation is so low in India?

India is behind the averages for several developing countries of Africa and Latin America. In the government, cabinets are largely all-male even when a woman becomes the Chief Minister or the Prime Minister.\n\nOne way to solve this problem is to make it legally binding to have a fair proportion of women in the elected bodies. This is what the Panchayati Raj has done in India. One-third of seats in local government bodies – in panchayats and municipalities – are now reserved for women. Now there are more than 10 lakh elected women representatives in rural and urban local bodies.\n\nWomen’s organisations and activists have been demanding a similar reservation of at least one-third of seats in the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies for women. A bill with this proposal has been pending before the Parliament for more than a decade. But there is no consensus over this among all the political parties. The bill has not been passed.\n\nGender division is an example that some form of social division needs to be expressed in politics. This also shows that disadvantaged groups do benefit when social divisions become a political issue.

    "text": "The problem begins when religion is seen as the basis of the nation. The example of Northern Ireland in Chapter 3 shows the dangers of such an approach to nationalism. The problem becomes more acute when religion is expressed in politics in exclusive and partisan terms, when one religion and its followers are pitted against another. This happens when beliefs of one religion are presented as superior to those of other religions, when the demands of one religious group are formed in opposition to another and when state power is used to establish domination of one religious group over the rest. This manner of using religion in politics is communal politics.\n\nCommunal politics is based on the idea that religion is the principal basis of social community. Communalism involves thinking\n\nI am not religious.\n\nWhy should I bother about communalism and secularism?\n\nalong the following lines. The followers of a particular religion must belong to one community. Their fundamental interests are the same. Any difference that they may have is irrelevant or trivial for community life. It also follows that people who follow different religions cannot belong to the same social community. If the followers of different religions have some commonalities these are superfi cial and immaterial, their interests are bound to be different and involve a conflict. In its extreme form, communalism leads to the belief that people belonging to different religions cannot live as equal citizens within one nation. Either, one of them has to dominate the rest or they have to form different nations.\n\nThis belief is fundamentally flawed. People of one religion do not have the same interests and aspirations in every context. Everyone has several other roles, positions and identities. There are many voices inside every community. All these voices have a right to be heard. Therefore any attempt to bring all followers of one religion together in context other than religion is bound to suppress many voices within that community.\n\nCommunalism can take various forms in politics:\n\n The most common expression of communalism is in everyday beliefs. These routinely involve religious prejudices, stereotypes of religious communities and belief in the superiority of one’s religion over other religions. This is so common\n\nthat we often fail to notice it, even when we believe in it.\n\n A communal mind often leads to a quest for political dominance of one’s own religious community. For those belonging to majority community, this takes the form of majoritarian dominance. For those belonging to the minority community, it can take the form of a desire to form a separate political unit.",

The pie chart below presents the population proportion of six major religious communities in the country. Since Independence, the total population of each community has increased substantially but their proportion in the country’s population has not changed much. In percentage terms, the population of the Hindus, Jains and Christians has declined marginally since 1961. The proportion of Muslim, Sikh and Buddhist population has increased slightly. There is a common but mistaken impression that the proportion of the Muslims in the country’s population is going to overtake other religious communities. Expert estimates done for the Prime Minister’s High Level Committee (popularly known as Sachar Committee) show that the proportion of the Muslims is expected to go up a little, by about 3 to 4 per cent, in the next 50 years. It proves that in overall terms, the population balance of diff erent religious communities is not likely to change in a big way.\n\nThe same is true of the major caste groups. The Census of India counts two social groups: the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. Both these broad groups include hundreds of castes or tribes whose names are listed in an offi cial Schedule. Hence the prefi x ‘Scheduled’ in their name. The Scheduled Castes, commonly known as Dalits, include those that were previously regarded as ‘outcaste’ in the Hindu social order and were subjected to exclusion and untouchability. The Scheduled Tribes, often referred to as Adivasis, include those communities that led a secluded life usually in hills and forests and did not interact much with the rest of society. In 2011, the Scheduled\n\nCastes were 16.6 per cent and the Scheduled Tribes were 8.6 per cent of the country’s population.\n\nThe Census does not yet count the Other Backward Classes, the group we discussed in Class IX. Hence there are some differences about their proportion in the country’s population. The National Sample Survey of 2004–05 estimates their population to be around 41 per cent. Thus the SC, ST and the OBC together account for about two-thirds of the country’s population and about three-fourths of the Hindu population.\n\nPopulation of different religious communities in India, 2011   \n![](images/debe9375641ba286ff28f6a3702625f1f9bef6059b3be99690ea0fd111303eed.jpg)  \nSource: Census of India, 2011\n\nI don’t care what my caste is.

Some of the older aspects of caste have persisted. Even now most people marry within their own caste or tribe. Untouchability has not ended completely, despite constitutional prohibition. Effects of centuries of advantages and disadvantages continue to be felt today. The caste groups that had access to education under the old system have done very well in acquiring modern education as well. Those groups that did not have access to education or were prohibited from acquiring it have\n\nnaturally lagged behind.

For example, in the past, the so-called ‘untouchable’ castes were denied the right to own land, while only the so-called ‘twice born’ castes had the right to education. Although this kind of explicit and formalised inequality based on caste is now outlawed, the eff ects of centuries of accumulated advantages and disadvantages continue to be felt. Moreover, new kinds of inequalities have also developed.\n\nThe relationship between caste and economic status has certainly changed a lot. Today, it is possible to fi nd very rich and very poor people in every caste, whether ‘low’ or ‘high’. This was not true even twenty or thirty years ago – it was very rare indeed to fi nd rich people among the ‘lowest’ castes. However, as this evidence from the National Sample Survey shows, caste continues to be very strongly linked to economic status in many important ways:\n\nThe average economic status (measured by criteria like monthly consumption expenditure) of caste groups still follows the old hierarchy – the ‘upper’ castes are best off , the Dalits and Adivasis are worst off , and the backward classes are in between.   \nAlthough every caste has some poor members, the proportion living n extreme poverty (below the offi cial ‘poverty line’) is much higher for the lowest castes and much lower for the upper castes, with the backward classes once again in between.   \nAlthough every caste has some members who are rich, the upper castes are heavily over-represented among the rich while the lower castes are severely under-represented.\n\nPercentage of population living below the poverty line, 1999– —2000   \n\n<table><tr><td>Caste and Community groups</td><td>Rural</td><td></td><td>Urban</td></tr><tr><td>Scheduled Tribes</td><td>45.8</td><td></td><td>35.6</td></tr><tr><td>Scheduled Castes</td><td>35.9</td><td></td><td>38.3</td></tr><tr><td>Other Backward Classes</td><td>27.0</td><td></td><td>29.5</td></tr><tr><td>Muslim Upper Castes</td><td>26.8</td><td></td><td>34.2</td></tr><tr><td>Hindu Upper Castes</td><td>11.7</td><td></td><td>9.9</td></tr><tr><td>Christian Upper Castes</td><td>9.6</td><td></td><td>5.4</td></tr><tr><td>Sikh Upper Castes</td><td>0.0</td><td></td><td>4.9</td></tr><tr><td>Other Upper Castes</td><td>16.0</td><td></td><td>2.7</td></tr><tr><td>All Groups</td><td>27.0</td><td></td><td>23.4</td></tr></table>\n\nNote: ‘Upper Caste’ here means those who are not from SC, ST, or OBC.

    "text": "We have so far looked at what caste does to politics. But it does not mean that there is only a one-way relation between caste and politics. Politics too infl uences the caste system and caste identities by bringing them into the political arena. Thus, it is not politics that gets caste-ridden, it\n\nis the caste that gets politicised. This takes several forms:\n\n Each caste group tries to become bigger by incorporating within it neighbouring castes or sub-castes which were earlier excluded from it.   \n Various caste groups are required to enter into a coalition with other castes or communities and thus enter into a dialogue and negotiation.   \n New kinds of caste groups have come up in the political arena like ‘backward’ and ‘forward’ caste groups.\n\nThus, caste plays different kinds of roles in politics. In some situations, expression of caste differences in politics gives many disadvantaged communities the space to demand their share of power. In this sense, caste politics has helped people from Dalits and OBC castes to gain better access to decision making. Several political and non-political organisations have been demanding and agitating for an end to discrimination against particular castes, for more dignity and more access to land, resources and opportunities.\n\nAt the same time, exclusive attention to caste can produce negative results as well. As in the case of religion, politics based on caste identity alone is not very healthy in a democracy. It can divert attention from other pressing issues like poverty, development and corruption. In some cases, caste division leads to tensions, confl ict and even violence.\n\n![](images/8bf8891fdead42b940bdc62082ff3040af806728ee9d018deb7f0f9f80a24078.jpg)\n\n1.

    "text": "What does a political party do? Basically, political parties fi ll political offi ces and exercise political power. Parties do so by performing a series of functions:\n\nParties contest elections. In most democracies, elections are fought\n\nmainly among the candidates put up by political parties. Parties select their candidates in different ways. In some countries, such as the USA, members and supporters of a party choose its candidates. Now more and more countries are following this method. In other countries like India, top party leaders choose candidates for contesting elections.\n\n2 Parties put forward different policies and programmes and the voters choose from them. Each of us may have different opinions and views on what policies are suitable for the society. But no government can handle such a large variety of views. In a democracy, a large number of similar opinions have to be grouped together to provide a direction in which policies can be formulated by the governments. This is what the parties do. A party reduces a vast multitude of opinions into a few basic positions which it\n\nsupports. A government is expected to base its policies on the line taken by the RULING P ARTY.\n\n3 Parties play a decisive role in making laws for a country. Formally, laws are debated and passed in the legislature. But since most of the members belong to a party, they go by the direction of the party leadership, irrespective of their personal opinions.   \n4 Parties form and run governments. As we noted last year, the big policy decisions are taken by political executive that comes from the political parties. Parties recruit leaders, train them and then make them ministers to run the government in the way they want.   \n5 Those parties that lose in the elections play the role of opposition to the parties in power, by voicing different views and criticising government for its failures or wrong policies. Opposition parties also mobilise opposition to the government.   \n6 Parties shape public opinion. They raise and highlight issues. Parties have lakhs of members and activists spread all over the country. Many of the pressure groups are the extensions of political parties among different sections of society. Parties sometimes also launch movements for the resolution of problems faced by people. Often opinions in the society crystallise on the lines parties take.   \n7 Parties provide people access to government machinery and welfare schemes implemented by governments. For an ordinary citizen it is easy to approach a local party leader than a government offi cer.\n\nThat is why, they feel close to parties even when they do not fully trust them. Parties have to be responsive to people’s needs and demands. Otherwise people can reject those parties in the next elections.",

    "text": "This list of functions in a sense answers the question asked above: we need political parties because they perform all these functions. But we still need to ask why modern democracies cannot exist without political parties. We can understand the necessity of political parties by imagining a situation without parties. Every candidate in the elections will be independent. So no one will be able to make any promises to the people about any major policy changes. The government may be formed, but its utility will remain ever uncertain. Elected representatives will be accountable to their constituency for what they do in the locality. But no one will be responsible for how the country will be run.\n\nWe can also think about it by looking at the non-party based elections to the panchayat in many states. Although, the parties do not contest formally, it is generally noticed that the village gets split into more than one faction, each of which puts up a ‘panel’ of its candidates. This is exactly what the party does. That is the reason we fi nd political parties in almost all countries of the world, whether these countries are big or small, old or new, developed or developing.\n\nThe rise of political parties is directly linked to the emergence of representative democracies.\n\n\nOkay, granted that we can’t live without political parties. But tell me on what grounds do people support a political party?\n\n\nRuling Party: Political party that runs government.\n\nAs we have seen, large societies need representative democracy. As societies became large and complex, they also needed some agency to gather different views on various issues and to present these to the government. They needed some ways, to bring various representatives together so that a\n\nresponsible government could be formed. They needed a mechanism to support or restrain the government, make policies, justify or oppose them. Political parties fulfi ll these needs that every representative government has. We can say that parties are a necessary condition for a democracy.\n\n![](images/502384c28572f69f17b101111427a0d930adb511847bf62ff19a4a57813c9175.jpg)\n\nCategorise these photographs by the functions of political parties they illustrate.

    "text": "In a democracy any group of citizens is free to form a political party. In this formal sense, there are a large number of political parties in each country. More than 750 parties are registered with the Election Commission of India. But not all these parties are serious contenders in the elections. Usually only a handful of parties are effectively in\n\nthe race to win elections and form the government. So the question is: how many major or effective parties are good for a democracy?\n\nIn some countries, only one party is allowed to control and run the government. These are called one-party systems. In Class IX, we noted that in China, only the Communist Party is allowed to\n\nrule. Although, legally speaking, people are free to form political parties, it does not happen because the electoral system does not permit free competition for power. We cannot consider one-party system as a good option because this is not a democratic option. Any democratic system must allow at least two parties to compete in elections and provide a fair chance for the competing parties to come to power.\n\nIn some countries, power usually changes between two main parties. Several other parties may exist, contest elections and win a few seats in the national legislatures. But only the two main parties have a serious chance of winning majority of seats to form government. Such a party system is called two-party system. The United States of America and the United Kingdom are examples of two-party system.\n\nIf several parties compete for power, and more than two parties have a reasonable chance of coming to power either on their own strength or in alliance with others, we call it a multiparty system. Thus in India, we have a multiparty system. In this system, the government is formed by various parties coming together in a\n\ncoalition. When several parties in a multi-party system join hands for the purpose of contesting elections and winning power, it is called an alliance or a front. For example, in India there were three such major alliances in 2004 parliamentary elections– the National Democratic Alliance, the United Progressive Alliance and the Left Front. The multiparty system often appears very messy and leads to political instability. At the same time, this system allows a variety of interests and opinions to enjoy political representation.\n\nSo, which of these is better? Perhaps the best answer to this very common question is that this is not a very good question. Party system is not something any country can choose. It evolves over a long time, depending on the nature of society, its social and regional divisions, its history of politics and its system of elections. These cannot be changed very quickly. Each country develops a party system that is conditioned by its special circumstances. For example, if India has evolved a multiparty system, it is because the social and geographical diversity in such a large country is not easily absorbed by two or even three parties. No system is ideal for all countries and all situations.",

This is the case in India as well. There are some country-wide parties, which are called ‘national parties’. These parties have their units in various states. But by and large, all these units follow the same policies, programmes and strategy that is decided at the national level.\n\nEvery party in the country has to register with the Election Commission. While the Commission treats all parties equally, it offers some special facilities to large and established parties. These parties are given a unique symbol – only the offi cial candidates of that party can use that election symbol. Parties that get this privilege and some other\n\nspecial facilities are ‘recognised’ by the Election Commission for this purpose. That is why these parties are called, ‘recognised political parties’. The Election Commission has laid down detailed criteria of the proportion of votes and seats that a party must get in order to be a recognised party. A party that secures at least six per cent of the total votes in an election to the Legislative Assembly of a State and wins at least two seats is recognised as a State party. A party that secures at least six per cent of the total votes in Lok Sabha elections or Assembly elections in four States and wins at least four seats in the Lok Sabha is recognised as a national party.\n\nAccording to this classifi cation, there were seven recognised national parties in the country in 2019. Let us learn something about each of these parties.\n\nFor more details about registration and recognition of political parties by the Election Commission of India, visit https:// eci.gov.in\n\n![](images/a66af1f9e0906c2a15e28d9ba6db2e3e6cb054056e19d1e5eb2d83f64c1ecd32.jpg)\n\nA l l I n d i a T r i n a m o o l Congress (AITC): Launched on 1 January 1998 under the leadership of Mamata\n\nBanerjee.

    "text": "Other than these seven parties, most of the major parties of the country are classifi ed by the Election Commission as ‘State parties’. These are commonly referred to as regional parties. Yet these parties need not be regional in their ideology or outlook. Some of these parties are all India parties that happen to have succeeded only in some states. Parties like the Samajwadi Party and Rashtriya Janata Dal have national level political organisation with units in several states. Some of these parties like Biju Janata Dal, Sikkim Democratic Front, Mizo National Front and Telangana Rashtra Samithi are conscious about their State identity.\n\nOver the last three decades, the number and strength of these parties has expanded. This made the Parliament of India politically more and more diverse. No one national party is able to secure on its own a majority in the Lok Sabha, until 2014. As a result, the national parties are compelled to form alliances with State parties. Since 1996, nearly every one of the State parties has got an opportunity to be a part of one or the other national level coalition government. This has contributed to the strengthening of federalism and democracy in our country.

    "text": "We have seen how crucial political parties are for the working of democracy. Since parties are the most visible face of democracy, it is natural that people blame parties for whatever is wrong with the working of democracy. All over the world, people express strong dissatisfaction with the failure of political parties to perform their functions well. This is the case in our country too. Popular dissatisfaction and criticism has focussed on four problem areas\n\nBerlusconi Puppet Theatre\n\nin the working of political parties. Political parties need to face and overcome these challenges in order to remain effective instruments of democracy.\n\nThe first challenge is lack of internal democracy within parties. All over the world there is a tendency in political parties towards the concentration of power in one or few leaders at the top. Parties do not keep membership registers, do not hold organisational meetings, and do not conduct internal elections regularly. Ordinary members of not get sufficient n what happens inside\n\nthe party. They do not have the means or the connections needed to infl uence the decisions. As a result, the leaders a s s u m e g r e a t e r p o w e r t o m a k e decisions in the name of the party. Since one or few l e a d e r s e x e r c i s e paramount power in the party, those who disagree with the leadership fi nd\n\n![](images/29f4a71d87d346f636ace53ce64773d2e446a819c4de600a22a5f6445656700a.jpg)\n\nsconi was the Prime ter of Italy.

More than loyalty to party principles and policies, personal loyalty to the leader becomes more important.\n\nThe second challenge of dynastic succession is related to the first one. Since most political parties do not practice open and transparent procedures for their functioning, there are very few ways for an ordinary worker to rise to the top in a party. Those who happen to be the leaders are in a position of unfair advantage to favour people close to them or even their family members. In many parties, the top positions are always controlled by members of one family. This is unfair to other members of that party. This is also bad for democracy, since people who do not have adequate experience or popular support come to occupy positions of power. This tendency is present in some measure all over the world, including in some of the older democracies.",

    "text": "The third challenge is about the growing role of money and muscle power in parties, especially during elections. Since parties are focussed only on winning elections, they tend to use short-cuts to win elections. They tend to nominate those candidates who have or can raise lots of money. Rich people and companies who give funds to the parties tend to have infl uence on the policies and decisions of the party. In some cases, parties support criminals who can win elections. Democrats all over the world are worried about the increasing role of rich people and big companies in democratic politics.\n\nThe fourth challenge is that very often parties do not seem to offer a meaningful choice to the voters. In order to offer meaningful choice, parties must be signifi cantly different. In recent years, there has been a decline in the ideological differences among parties in most parts of the world. For example, the difference between the Labour Party and the Conservative Party in Britain is very little. They agree on more fundamental aspects but differ only in details on how policies are to be framed and implemented. In our country too, the differences among all the major parties on the economic policies have reduced. Those who want really different policies have no option available to them. Sometimes people cannot even elect very different leaders either, because the same set of leaders keep shifting from one party to another.\n\nThis cartoon was drawn during the Presidency of George Bush of the Republican Party in the USA.

This new law has helped bring defection down. At the same time, this has made any dissent even more diffi cult. MPs and MLAs have to accept whatever the party leaders decide.\n\n The Supreme Court passed an order to reduce the influence of money and criminals. Now, it is mandatory for every candidate who contests elections to fi le an AFFIDAVIT giving details of his property and criminal cases pending against him. The new system has made a lot of information available to the public. But there is no system to check if the information given by the candidates is true. As yet we do not know if it has led to decline in the infl uence of the rich and the criminals.\n\n The Election Commission passed an order making it necessary for political parties to hold their organisational elections and fi le their income tax returns. The parties have started doing so but sometimes it\n\nis mere formality. It is not clear if this step has led to greater internal democracy in political parties.\n\nBesides these, many suggestions are often made to reform political parties:\n\n A law should be made to regulate the internal affairs of political parties. It should be made compulsory for political parties to maintain a register of its members, to follow its own constitution, to have an independent authority, to act as a judge in case of party disputes, to hold open elections to the highest posts.\n\n It should be made mandatory for political parties to give a minimum number of tickets, about one-third, to women candidates. Similarly, there should be a quota for women in the decision making bodies of the party.\n\n There should be state funding of elections. The government should give parties money to support their election expenses. This support could be given in kind: petrol, paper, telephone, etc. Or it could be given in cash on the basis of the votes secured by the party in the last election.\n\nThese suggestions have not yet been accepted by political parties. If and when these are accepted these could lead to some improvement. But we must be very careful about legal solutions to political problems. Over-regulation of political parties can be counter-productive. This would force all parties to fi nd ways to cheat the law. Besides, political parties will not agree to pass a law that they do not like.\n\nThere are two other ways in which political parties can be reformed. One, people can put",

While many welcomed his decision, some did not like it. “Now I think Bangladesh will have a chance to choose between good and bad and eventually have a good government,” said Shahedul Islam, a government offi cial. “That government, we hope, would not only keep itself away from corruption but also make fi ghting corruption and black money a top priority.”\n\nBut leaders of traditional political parties who dominated the country’s politics for decades were apprehensive. “There was no debate (over him) winning the Nobel, but politics is diff erent – very challenging and often controversial,” said a senior leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Some others were highly critical. They asked why he was rushing into politics. “Is he being planted in politics by mentors from outside the country,” asked one political observer.\n\nDo you think Yunus made a right decision to fl oat a new political party?\n\nDo you agree with the statements and fears expressed by various people? How do you want this new party organised to make it diff erent from other parties? If you were the one to begin this political party, how would you defend it?",

    "text": "Do you remember how students in Madam Lyngdoh’s class argued about democracy? This was in Chapter 2 of Class IX textbook. It emerged from that conversation that democracy is a better form of government when compared with dictatorship or any other alternative. We felt that democracy was better because it:\n\n Promotes equality among citizens;   \n Enhances the dignity of the individual;   \nImproves the quality of decision-making;   \nProvides a method to resolve confl icts; and   \n Allows room to correct mistakes.\n\nAre these expectations realised under democracies? When we talk to people around us, most of them support democracy against other alternatives, such as rule by a monarch or military or religious leaders. But not so many of them would be satisfied with the democracy in practice. So we face a dilemma: democracy is seen to be good in\n\n© RK Laxman - Brushing up the years   \n![](images/c0a1f1ec6d6537bad6896d6567d5e8978d2461ca77c52fe2e4d96aa8b851efe8.jpg)  \nIs democracy all about coping with multiple pressures and accommodating diverse demands?\n\nprinciple, but felt to be not so good in its practice. This dilemma invites us to think hard about the outcomes of democracy. Do we prefer democracy only for moral reasons? Or are there some prudential reasons to support democracy too?\n\nOver a hundred countries of the world today claim and practice some kind of democratic politics: they have formal constitutions, they hold elections, they have parties and they guarantee rights of citizens. While these features are common to most of them, these democracies are very much different from each other in terms of their social situations, their economic achievements and their cultures. Clearly, what may be achieved or not achieved under each of these democracies will be very different. But is there something that we can expect from every democracy, just because it is democracy?\n\nOur interest in and fascination for democracy often pushes us into taking a position that democracy can address all socio-economic and political problems. If some of our expectations are not met, we start blaming the idea of democracy. Or, we start doubting if we are living in a democracy. The fi rst step towards thinking carefully about the outcomes of democracy is to recognise that democracy is just a form of government. It can only create conditions for achieving something. The citizens have to take advantage of those conditions and achieve those goals. Let us examine some of the things we can reasonably expect from democracy and examine the record of democracy.",

    "text": "There are some things that democracy must provide. In a democracy, we are most concerned with ensuring that people will have the right to choose their rulers and people will have control over the rulers. Whenever possible and necessary, citizens should be able to participate in decision making, that affects them all. Therefore, the most basic outcome of democracy should be that it produces a government that is accountable to the citizens, and responsive to the needs and expectations of the citizens.\n\nBefore we go into this question, we face another common question: Is the democratic government effi cient? Is it effective? Some people think that democracy produces less effective government. It is, of course, true that non-democratic rulers do not have to bother about deliberation in assemblies or worry about majorities and public opinion. So, they can be very quick and efficient in decision making and implementation. Democracy is based on the idea of deliberation and negotiation. So, some delay is bound to take place. Does that make democratic government ineffi cient?\n\nLet us think in terms of costs. Imagine a government that may take decisions very fast. But it may take decisions that are not accepted by the people and may therefore face problems. In contrast, the democratic government will take more time to follow procedures before arriving at a decision. But because it has followed procedures, its decisions may be both more acceptable to the people and more effective. So, the cost of time that democracy pays is perhaps worth it.\n\n![](images/14fd6071a5487176b93405ed7deec8590fee13b7718609b683c133ed3af92a9f.jpg)\n\nNow look at the other side – democracy ensures that decision making will be based on norms and procedures. So, a citizen who wants to know if a decision was taken through the correct procedures can fi nd this out. She has the right and the means to examine the process of decision making. This is known as transparency. This factor is often missing from a non-democratic government. Therefore, when we are trying to fi nd out the outcomes of democracy, it is right to expect democracy to produce a government that follows procedures and is accountable to the people. We can also expect that the democratic government develops mechanisms for citizens to hold the government accountable and mechanisms for citizens to take part in decision making whenever they think fi t.\n\nIf you wanted to measure democracies on the basis of this expected outcome, you would look for the following practices and institutions: regular, free and fair elections; open public debate on\n\nCan you think of what and how the government knows about you and your family (for example ration cards and voter identity cards)? What are the sources of information for you about the government?\n\nSo, the best outcome of democracy is that it is a democracy! That is what we have discovered after all this mental gymnastics?\n\n![](images/11fba28e6719c33cc5594ea5c88e671882061cc512457977c189121461fb184d.jpg)",

Democracies have had greater success in setting up regular and free elections and in setting up conditions for open public debate. But most democracies fall short of elections that provide a fair chance to everyone and in subjecting every decision to public debate. Democratic governments do not have a very good record when it comes to sharing information with citizens. All one can say in favour of democratic regimes is that they are much better than any n o n - d e m o c r a t i c r e g i m e i n these respects.\n\nIn substantive terms, it may be reasonable to expect from democracy a government that is attentive to the needs and demands of the people and is largely free of corruption. The record of democracies is not impressive on these two counts. Democracies often frustrate the needs of the people and often ignore\n\nthe demands of a majority of its population. The routine tales of corruption are enough to convince us that democracy is not free of this evil. At the same time, there is nothing to show that non-democracies are less corrupt or more sensitive to the people.\n\nThere is one respect in which democratic government is certainly better than its alternatives: democratic government is legitimate government. It may be slow, less efficient, not always very responsive or clean. But a democratic government is people’s own government. That is why, there is an overwhelming support for the idea of democracy all over the world. As the accompanying evidence from South Asia shows, the support exists in countries with democratic regimes as well as countries without democratic regimes. People wish to be ruled by representatives elected by them. They also believe that democracy is suitable for their country.

All individuals have equal weight in electing representatives. Parallel to the process of bringing individuals into the political arena on an equal footing, we fi nd growing economic inequalities.

This reduces the possibility of these tensions becoming explosive or violent.\n\nNo society can fully and permanently resolve confl icts among different groups. But we can certainly learn to respect these differences and we can also evolve mechanisms to negotiate the differences. Democracy is best suited to produce this outcome. Non-democratic regimes\n\noften turn a blind eye to or suppress internal social differences. Ability to handle social differences, divisions and confl icts is thus a defi nite plus point of democratic regimes. But the example of Sri Lanka reminds us that a democracy must fulfi l two conditions in order to achieve this outcome:\n\nIt is necessary to understand that democracy is not simply rule by majority opinion. The majority always needs to work with the minority so that governments function to represent the general view. Majority and minority opinions are not permanent.   \n It is also necessary that rule by majority does not become rule by majority community in terms of religion or race or linguistic group, etc. Rule by majority means that in case of every decision or in case of\n\nAll you are saying is that democracy ensures that people do not break each other’s head. This is not harmony. Should we be happy about it?\n\n![](images/6b4176dfe1aeaf7d0d1436952c2da70f0ebdf63889aae9b2e0901744ae851e88.jpg)\n\nevery election, different persons and groups may and can form a majority. Democracy remains democracy only as long as every citizen has a chance of being in majority at some point\n\nof time. If someone is barred from being in majority on the basis of birth, then the democratic rule ceases to be accommodative for that person or group.\n\n![](images/c70703e815e4e2519485a675bdf41bcf4ed309d503c2212317d5749114f7e630.jpg)\n\n![](images/2da5b3d894b6ea52e719cb14c629cf1b2c58a871bc43ecfec18dbf6fdc43463d.jpg)  \nThe two images depict two different kinds of effects democratic politics can have on social divisions. Take one example for each image and write a paragraph each on the outcome of democratic politics in both situations.\n\n![](images/b1667fd8dbf70cfc310e462dde99cba4de27da20eea8cf567724ffaf4c46c5c4.jpg)",

    "text": "Democracy stands much superior to any other form of government in promoting dignity and freedom of the individual. Every individual wants to receive respect from fellow beings. Often confl icts arise among individuals because some feel that they are not treated with due respect. The passion for respect and freedom are the basis of democracy. Democracies throughout the world have recognised this, at least in principle. This has been achieved\n\nin various degrees in various democracies. For societies which have been built for long on the basis of subordination and domination, it is not a simple matter to recognise that all individuals are equal.\n\nTake the case of dignity of women. Most societies across the world were historically male dominated societies. Long struggles by women have created some sensitivity today that respect to and equal treatment of women are\n\nI am anxious about my board exams. But democracy has so many exams. And millions of examiners!\n\n![](images/3a8d1c71319738e955c6761762a1834222c8e433d25ccb61691d5af379d5fff3.jpg)\n\nnecessary ingredients of a democratic society. That does not mean that women are actually always treated with respect. But once the principle is recognised, it becomes easier for women to wage a struggle against what is now unacceptable legally and morally. In a non-democratic set up, this unacceptability would not have legal basis because the principle of individual freedom and dignity would not have the legal and moral force there. The same is true of caste inequalities. Democracy in India has strengthened the claims of the disadvantaged and discriminated castes for equal status and equal opportunity. There are instances still of caste-based inequalities and atrocities, but these lack the moral and legal foundations. Perhaps, it is the recognition that makes ordinary citizens value their democratic rights.\n\nExpectations from democracy also function as the criteria for judging any democratic country.\n\nWhat is most distinctive about democracy is that its examination never gets over. As democracy passes one test, it produces another test. As people get some benefi ts of democracy, they ask for more and want to make democracy even better. That is why, when we ask people about the way democracy functions, they will always come up with more expectations, and many complaints. The fact that people are complaining is itself a testimony to the success of democracy: it shows that people have developed awareness and the ability to expect and to look critically at power holders and the high and the mighty. A public expression of dissatisfaction with democracy shows the success of the democratic project: it transforms people from the status of a subject into that of a citizen. Most individuals today believe that their vote makes a difference to the way the government is run and to their own self-interest.\n\n![](images/3e8b838f04a62f24a9ce6f709639fee40d08ba31020e3461753f9f6dcf9d882f.jpg)  \nRosa Parks Still Inspires\n\nBelief in the effi cacy of vote is placed above the calculus of utility   \n![](images/e35f5b08b3a3f0592f2ba4357e6669fe6d4a122cdb2c60a74fda0ab73cbea1a6.jpg)  \nThe above cartoon and graph illustrate a point made in this section (Dignity and freedom of the citizens).
