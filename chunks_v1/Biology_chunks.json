Several organisms need food to maintain body temperature as well. A variety of substances are taken as food by every organisms from single celluar organisms like amoeba to the complex multicellular organisms like the human body. Even within the human body the cells require a wide variety of substances as food to carryout their functions. The mode of acquiring food varies from organism to organism.\n\nYou have studied in the previous classes about how different organisms get their food. Let us recall them.\n\nWhat are autotrophs? How do autotrophs get their food?\n\nWhat are heterotrophs? How do heterotrophs get their food?\n\nLet us study about autotrophic and heterotrophic modes of nutrition and find out why most plants are called as autotrophs.",

They acquire nutrients like mineral salts and water from the soil as well as some gases from the air.

We know that among all life processes, the process of photosynthesis makes plants “the universal food providers” for all living organisms.\n\nYou have studied something about photosynthesis in your earlier classes.

The process of photosynthesis is very complex. Several reactions takes place in this process and intermediate compounds are also formed. Scientists had tried to formulate a simple equation to indicate photosynthesis over 200 years. The equation that is used widely is formulated and proposed by C.B. Van Neil in 1931 . His opinion was,\n\n“for each molecule of carbohydrate formed, one molecule of water and one molecule of oxygen is produced”. Though photosynthesis is a very complex process, we use the following simple equation.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm {C O} _ {2} + 2 \\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} \\xrightarrow [ \\text {C h l o r o p h y l l} ]{\\text {L i g h t}} \\mathrm {C H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} + \\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} + \\mathrm {O} _ {2}\n$$\n\nWhat would be the reaction to show that glucose $\\mathrm { ( C _ { 6 } H _ { 1 2 } O _ { 6 } ) }$ is being synthesized? Write down a balanced equation to show this.\n\n(Refer the lessons Chemical equations, Carbon and its compounds in your textbook of physical science class X).\n\nVan Neil first worked on purple sulphur bacteria and found light plays a specific role in photosynthesis. Instead of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ they used $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { S }$ as a starting material. Here no oxygen is liberated during photosynthesis instead, elemental sulphur is evolved. Later he envisioned a similar process of photosynthesis in plants and proposed the above mentioned equation. Later Robert Hill showed that $\\mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ is released from water during this reaction. Then the equation was modified as follows.",

    "text": "Let us discuss an experiment on photosynthesis. This one helps us to find out about the role of air in the process of photosynthesis. It is interesting to learn about the experiment which is one of the several milestones in the gradual development of our understanding of Photosynthesis.\n\nJoseph Priestly (1733-1804) in 1770 performed a series of experiments that revealed the essential role of air on the growth of green plants\n\n(photosynthesis was still not known to scientists at that time). You may recall, Oxygen was discovered by Priestly in 1774. The name oxygen was coined later by Lavoisier in the year 1775. Priestly observed that a candle burning in a closed bell jar, soon gets extinguished. Similarly, a mouse would soon suffocate in a closed space of the bell jar. He concluded that a burning candle or an animal, both somehow, damage air. When he placed a mint plant in the same bell jars, he found that the mouse stayed alive and the candle when lighted from outside continued burning in the presence of the mint plant. Priestly hypothesized as follows: ‘Plants restore the air what breathing animals and burning candles remove’.\n\n![](images/e5ec8aaf49de2e3fd7a5137ce67a1e965b63cdaace5bdce351056305c057788a.jpg)\n\n![](images/7d4ab83cf6c37f32454c5f68dd029108d8cfecd4c141026f9606b73e6a8388ec.jpg)\n\n![](images/9802def4ea9f9697216855819cca2658ca6a4239c0e0d4ff08edda9c890a0c5f.jpg)\n\n![](images/49330fc252409d9f7332356491c2b8e72410703c44b492a2491bfa598e84f3ba.jpg)  \nfig-3: Priestly experiment\n\nDo you find any relationship between candle, rat, mint plant ?

If energy is released when carbon dioxide and water is formed by combining oxygen with carbon and hydrogen, then what about the reverse?. What about forming oxygen again and putting it back in the air. Eventually, scientists learned that the energy situation would also reverse. Oxygen formation would use up energy. That means if plants\n\nform oxygen they have to get energy to make it possible. Where did the energy come from?\n\nA Dutch scientist, Jan Ingenhousz (1730-1799), found the answer. He studied the way in which plants form oxygen. In 1779, he noticed that it happened only in the presence of light. In an experiment with the aquatic plant, Hydrilla, he observed that in bright sunlight, small bubbles formed around the green parts while in the dark they did not form. He also found that the gas present in the bubbles was oxygen.\n\nIt was further confirmed when Engelman in the early $2 0 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century ingeniously detected the point of maximum rate of photosynthesis. He used a strand of algae and exposed it to different colours of light (the colours that we see in a rainbow) Then he used oxygen sensitive bacteria and found that they crowd around areas illuminated with red and blue rays of light. This led to more studies on effect of light on photosynthesis, the role of different coloured compounds called pigments in plants and the utilization of light energy.",

How is it that new leaves which look dark red in colour in several plants turn green? Do plants having reddish or yellowish leaves also carry out photosynthesis? What made plants carry out photosynthesis while even green coloured animals (like some birds )could not? Questions like these remained challenges until scientists could isolate the green coloured substance from plant parts and study its nature.\n\nEstablishment of Ingenhousz’s proposition came after several experiments till the mid $2 0 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century when scientists could also locate the site of photosynthesis and even isolate it. Around four decades after Ingenhouszs’ proposition scientists could only isolate the green substance to observe its nature and find out whether photosynthesis could be carried out with it. This had become possible in the year 1817 due to the work of two scientists Pelletier and Caventou who obtained an extract of the green coloured substance and named it ‘chlorophyll’ meaning green leaf.\n\nIt was also found that pigments in addition to chlorophyll, carotenoids and phycobilins could also aid in the process of photosynthesis by passing on the energy of sunlight trapped by them to chlorophyll.",

Arnon was able to break up plant cells so gently that whole chloroplasts could be obtained that could carry through photosynthesis.\n\n![](images/e07c7c4da972c6f57ff588bb5c92117f050e211937ad94f182c4c3484f22fdad.jpg)  \nfig-8: T-S of chloroplast\n\nIt has been found that the chloroplast is a membranous structure, consisting of 3 membranes. The third layer forms stacked sack like structures called as grana. It is believed to be a site for trapping of solar energy. The intermediary fluid filled portion is called as stroma. It is believed to be responsible for enzymatic reactions leading to the synthesis of glucose, which in turn join together to form starch.\n\nSubstances found in chloroplast which capture sunlight are called photosynthetic pigments. There are several types of photosynthetic pigments involved in the process to produce organic molecules like glucose in plants.\n\nChlorophyll is such a pigment which contain one atom of magnesium. It is similar in structure to the haem of haemoglobin. (The iron containing red pigment that transports oxygen in blood.) Two major kinds of chlorophylls are associated with thylakoid membranes. Chlorophyll ‘a’ is blue-green in colour and chlorophyll ‘b’ is yellow-green colour. Around 250 to 400 pigment molecules are grouped as light harvesting complex or photosynthetic unit in each thylakoid. Such innumerable units function together in chloroplasts of green plants in the process of photosynthesis.\n\nDuring photosynthesis several events occur in the chloroplast some of them are:\n\n1. Conversion of light energy to chemical energy   \n2. Splitting of water molecule (photolysis of water)   \n3. Reduction of carbondioxide to carbohydrates\n\nLight is required to initiate several events while several may continue even in absence of it. That would mean, once light energy has been captured it can help reactions to continue even in the dark. Light dependent events\n\nor reactions are called light reactions and it has been found to take place in grana, while the rest are called light independent or dark reactions and they occur in the stroma.",

A series of chemical reactions occur in a very quick succession initiated by light and therefore the phase is technically called the photochemical phase or light dependent reaction. The light reaction takes place in chlorophyll containing thylakoids called grana of chloroplasts. Several steps occur in the light dependent reaction.\n\nStep-I : The chlorophyll on exposure to light energy becomes activated by absorbing photons. (Photon is the smallest unit of light energy)\n\nStep-II: The energy is used in splitting the water molecule into two component ions named hydrogen $\\mathrm { ( H ^ { + } ) }$ , hydroxyl ion (OH- ).\n\n$$\n\\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} \\quad \\mathrm {H} ^ {+} + \\mathrm {O H} ^ {-}\n$$\n\nThe reaction is known as photolysis, which means splitting by light (photo means light, lysis means breaking).

Hence it is also called Hill’s reaction.\n\nStep-III: The highly reactive $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ , OH-- ions of water undergo quick change as described below.\n\nOH- ions through a series of steps produce water $\\left( \\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } 0 \\right)$ and Oxygen $( \\mathrm { O } _ { 2 } )$ .

Some organisms break down the food materials outside the body and then absorb it. For example, bread moulds, yeast, mushrooms etc. which are called saprophytes. Some other organisms derive nutrition from plants or animals without killing them. This type of parasitic nutritive strategy is used by a wide variety of organisms like Cuscuta, lice, leeches and tape worms. Others take in whole material and break it down inside their bodies. What can be taken in and broken down depends on the bodys’ design and it’s function.\n\nSince the food and the way it is obtained differs, the digestive system is also different in various organisms. In single celled organisms, like amoeba the food may be taken in by the entire surface but as the complexity of the organism increases, different parts become specialized to perform different functions.\n\n![](images/a733e960ed5ee87e5070016bb62fc4db4aa1069af94630d81ffbeb1e9f896c14.jpg)\n\n![](images/fc462a5241665fd9bb513e1591823c71247b824cb5a1a87a1ca8ea7389780edb.jpg)\n\nFor example amoeba [fig-9(a)] takes in food using temporary finger like extensions (pseudopodia) of the cell surface which fuse over the food particle forming food vacuole. Inside the food vacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones. Then diffuse into the cytoplasm. The remaining undigested material is moved to the surface of the cell and thrown out. In Paramoecium [fig-9(b)], which is also a unicellular organism the cell has a definite shape. Food is taken in at a specific spot. Food is moved to the spot by the movement of cilia which covers the entire surface of the cell, where the food is ingested (cytostome).",

Cuscuta reflexa\n\nhas been found to have very little amount of chlorophyll and instead absorbs food through haustoria. They are root like structures that penetrate the tissue of a host plant and may kill it. The slender, string like stems of the dodder may be yellow, orange, pink, or brown in colour. It’s leaves are reduced to minute scales. The dodder’s flowers, in nodule like clusters, are made up of tiny yellow or white bell-like petals.\n\nThe dodder’s seed germinates, forming an anchoring root, and then sends up a slender stem that grows in a spiral fashion until it reaches a host plant. It then twines around the stem of the host plant and forms haustoria, which penetrate through it. Water is drawn through the haustoria from the host plant’s xylem, and nutrients are drawn from its phloem. Meanwhile, the root rots away after contact has been made with a host stem. As the dodder grows, it sends out new haustoria (parasitic roots) and establishes itself very firmly on the host plant. After growing in a few spirals around one host shoot, the dodder finds its way to another, and it continues to twine and branch until it resembles a fine, densely tangled web of thin stems enveloping the host plant.

    "text": "Food in the form of a soft slimy substance where some proteins and carbohydrates have already been broken down is called chyme. Now the food material passes from the stomach to the small intestine. Here the ring like muscles called pyloric sphincters relax to open the passage into the small intestine. The sphincters are responsible for regulating the opening of the passage such that only small quantities of the food material may be passed into the small intestine at a time.\n\nThe small intestine is the longest part of the alimentary canal. Its proximal part is called duodenum. It is the site of further digestion of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. It receives the secretion of liver and pancreas for this purpose. These juices render the internal condition of the intestine gradually to a basic or alkaline one.\n\nFats are digested by converting them into small globule like forms by the help of the bile juice secreted from liver. This process is called emulsification.\n\nPancreatic juice secreted from pancreas contains enzymes like trypsin for carrying on the process of digestion of proteins and lipase for fats.\n\nWalls of the small intestine secrete intestinal juice called succusentericus which carry this process further that is small molecules of proteins are broken down to further smaller molecules. The same is the condition with fats. Carbohydrate digestion that started in the mouth and did not occur in the stomach, resumes now as the medium gradually changes to an alkaline one and the enzymes become active for carbohydrate breakdown.",

Internally, intestinal wall has a number of finger like projections called Microvilli. The villi increase the surface area for absorption. Blood vessels and lymph vessels are present in the form of a network in the villi.\n\nProducts of digestion are absorbed first into the villi and from here into the blood vessels and lymph vessels. Thus after maximum absorption of food in the small intestine the rest passes into the large intestine. Here most of the water present is taken up from this material. This material is then expelled through the anus which is the last part of the alimentary canal. This passage of undigested material from the body by the way of anus is called defecation. Food that passes out of the anus still contains considerable amount of proteins, fats and carbohydrates, roughages or fibres of either carbohydrates or proteins.

    "text": "The human alimentary canal usually functions remarkably well considering how badly we treat it on occasions! Sometimes it rebels, and we either feel sick or have indigestion.\n\nVomiting is the body’s method of ridding itself of unwanted or harmful substances from the stomach. The peristaltic movements of the stomach and oesophagus reverse their normal direction and the food is expelled. There are many causes of vomiting, but one of the most common is over eating, especially when the food contains a high proportion of fat. Vomiting also occurs when we eat something very indigestible or poisonous.\n\nWhen we have a greenish vomit usually called as ‘bilious’ or ‘liverish’, we get a bitter taste and it is often the result of having over eaten. The liver is unable to cope with the excessive fat and we get a feeling of nausea.\n\nIndigestion is a general term used when there is difficulty in digesting food. Healthy people can usually avoid problems related to digestion by:\n\na) having simple, well balanced meals   \nb) eating food in a leisurely manner   \nc) thoroughly masticating the food   \nd) avoiding taking violent exercise soon after eating food   \ne) Drinking plenty of water and having regular bowel movements.\n\nA more serious form of indigestion is caused by stomach and duodenal ulcers. These conditions occur more often in people who may be described as hurried or worried. Thus, ulcers occur more often in busy people who get into the habit of hurrying over meals and rushing from one activity to another without sufficient rest. Those who are able to relax, who are not continually tensed up, and who live at a slower pace, seldom get ulcers. You studied about recent researches in the peptic ulcers caused by some bacteria in previous classes.\n\nProper functioning of all life processes require adequate amount of food in all living organisms. It is not just the intake of food but its assimilation and expulsion of wastes that play an important role. In take of fibre rich food avoids constipation.",

In the chapter, on nutrition we have discussed how the body draws out nutrients from the food taken in. The food provides energy for all the biological activities only after break down through the process known as respiration. Thus, respiration leads to final utilization of food. Normally respiration takes place in oxygen rich enveronment. Cells of the living body use food constantly to help our body to function properly. They require the presence of gas, food material and some chemicals.\n\nThe term ‘respiration’ derived from Latin word ‘respire’ meaning ‘to breathe’, refers to the whole chain of processes from the inhalation of air to the use of oxygen in the cells.

    "text": "The term respiration came into use, a century after the word breathing was used, way back in the $1 4 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century. It was used much before people knew that air is a mixture of gases. They hardly knew anything about all the life processes that took place internally in a living body. Respiration which was used as a medical term, usually referred to as a process involving passage of air and production of body heat.\n\nIt was not until $1 8 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century when Lavoisier and Priestley did a comprehensive work on properties of gases, their exchange and respiration that we came to know something about how the process of gaseous exchange goes on, in our body. You have already studied about\n\n![](images/1e1daad3be4bbbbb7fb51a79a89dd40c01c1a6e7e3ad17639f01a9b1e178b9ab.jpg)  \nfig-1: Lavoisier\n\nsome of Priestley’s experiments in earlier classes (You have an account of it in the chapter on nutrition as well). Recall the concepts and answer the following.\n\nCan it be said that Priestley’s experiment helped us to find out more about composition of air? How?\n\nLavoisier also carried out several experiments to understand the property of gases. In his early experiments, it is clear that Lavoisier thought that the gas liberated on heating powdered charcoal in a belljar kept over water in a trough was like fixed air. In those days carbon dioxide was known as fixed air. The next series of experiments dealt with the combustion of phosphorus in a belljar. From these studies Lavoisier showed that whatever in the atmospheric air which combined with the phosphorus, was not water vapour. His final words are that the substance which combines with the phosphorus is “either air itself, or another elastic fluid present, in a certain proportion, in the air which we breathe”. This was the respirable air, a component of air that also helped in burning.\n\nWhat was produced by combustion according to Lavoisier?\n\nWhat did Lavoisier find out about air from his experiments?\n\nWhat conclusion can be drawn from Lavoisier’s experiments?",

    "text": "Lavoisier noted that there was a profound difference between the air in which combustion of a metal had been carried out and the one which had served for respiration. The air that we breathe out precipitated lime water while that after heating metal did not.\n\nFrom this he deduced that there were two processes involved in respiration, and that of these he probably knew only one. Therefore, he carried out another experiment by which he showed that about one sixth of the volume of ‘vitiated air’(a term used then to show air from which the component needed for burning had been removed) consists of chalky acid gas (fixed air). Therefore, to recreate common air from vitiated air, it was not enough merely to add the appropriate amount of air needed for burning or respirable air; the existing chalky acid gas must also be removed.\n\nHe drew immediately the logical conclusion regarding the process of respiration. Either eminently respirable air is changed in the lungs to chalky acid air; or an exchange takes place, the eminently respirable air being absorbed, and an almost equal volume of chalky acid air being given up to the air from the lungs. He had to admit that there were strong grounds for believing that eminently respirable air did combine with the blood to produce the red colour. (But in due course the scientists identified that due to haemoglobin the blood is red in colour.)\n\n![](images/b10e25ee606b47f4fd6cbcd687a8feaca24883fe411e7e43320d1438e58e6a4c.jpg)  \nfig-2: Priestley\n\nLavoisier’s findings lead way to several other researchers.\n\nWhich gas do you think is Lavoisier talking about when he says chalky acid gas?\n\nWhich gas according to him is respirable air?\n\nWhat steps in the process of respiration does Lavoisier mention asN an inference of his experiments?\n\nA few lines from a textbook of Human Physiology, written by a renowned chemist, John Daper around mid-19th century goes like this..\n\n‘‘The chief materials which a living being receives are matter that can be burnt, water and oxygen gas; and out of the action of theseG upon one another, all the physical phenomena of its life arise. What the body expels out is water, oxide of carbon, phosphorous, sulphur and others.’’",

The organs involved are mainly the lungs. You can’t see your lungs, but it’s easy to feel them in action. Put your hands on your chest and breathe in very deeply.

See how the diaphragm works in the figure.\n\nWhat is the role of diaphragm and ribs in respiration? Are both active in men and women?\n\nThe chest wall is made up of ribs, muscles, and the skin. The ribs are attached at an angle to the spine (if you run your finger along one of your ribs, you will notice that it extends downward from the spine). When we inhale, the chest wall moves up and expands. This causes an increase in the volume of the chest cavity.\n\nThe diaphragm may be imagined as the ‘floor’ if you think of the chest cavity as a “room.” When the diaphragm is relaxed when we breath out, it is in the shape of a dome with the convex side of the dome extending into the chest cavity. When the diaphragm contracts during inhalation it flattens out a bit or the dome moves downward. As a result, the volume of the chest cavity is increased.\n\nWhen the diaphragm flattens and the volume of the chest cavity is increased, its internal pressure decreases and the air from the outside rushes into the lungs. This is inspiration (inhalation).\n\nThen the reverse occurs. The chest wall is lowered and moves inward, and the diaphragm relaxes and assumes its dome shape. These changes increase the pressure on the lungs; their elastic tissue contracts and squeezes the air out through the nose to the external atmosphere. This is expiration (exhalation).",

    "text": "The term cellular respiration refers to the pathway by which cells release energy by breaking the chemical bonds of glucose molecules. Thus cellular respiration is the essential processes of life. So living cells must carry out cellular respiration. It can be in the presence of oxygen that is ‘aerobic respiration’, or in the absence of oxygen as in bacterial respiration by anaerobic method which is called fermentation. The substances become sour because of ethyl alchohol or lactic acid is produced in this process. In Animals the anaerobic respiration leads to formation of lactic acid from glucose. In anaerobic repiration few ATP molecules are produced. Cellular respiration in prokaryotic cells like that of bacteria occurs within the cytoplasm. In eukaryotic cells cytoplasm and mitochondria are the sites of the reactions. The produced energy is stored in mitochondria in the form of ATP. That is why mitochondria are called “power houses of the cell”.\n\nThe exact chemical details of the breakdown of sugar or other foods within a living cell does not take place as a single reaction, but occurs in a series of small steps.\n\nHow does this affect the energy release?

Each ATP molecule gives 7200 calories of energy. This energy is stored in the form of phosphate bonds. If the bond is broken the stored energy is released.\n\nDo cells of alveoli or lungs also require oxygen to carry out cellular respiration? Why/Why not?\n\nIn short, at cellular level we could have the following pathways starting with glucose (It is one example, remember that there are other components of food as well).",

    "text": "After undergoing strenous exercise, we feel pain in muscles. Does adequate oxygen reach the muscles?\n\nWhat is being formed in the muscles?\n\nWhen you sprint a hundred yards, you do a considerable amount of muscular work. But you do not start a race by standing on the track and panting for a few minutes to stoke up with oxygen first. In fact you can run the race with very little extra breathing. The fastest sprinters do not breathe at all when running a hundred yards. After you have reached the destiny, however, you feel very different. Depending on your state of training, and on how hard you ran, you will pant for some minutes after the race, until your breathing gradually returns to normal.\n\nThese facts could be linked up with what we have learned so far about ATP. It might be that the race was run on the energy\n\nproduced when the ATP already present in your muscles was being converted to ADP. Unfortunately this pleasantly simple idea is inadequate, because we only carry sufficient ATP in a muscle to last for about half a second when doing vigorous exercise. There must be some other explanation for the way in which we can produce energy first and then use up oxygen later.\n\nOne approach in the study of this problem was to analyze the blood of a person during and after exercise. For obvious reasons the athlete taking part in the experiment had to stay still where the apparatus was. He pedaled a stationary bicycle, or ran on a tread mill (belt moving as fast backwards as the athlete moved forwards). Some results are shown in the graph. Vigorous exercise lasted for nine minutes (shown by the bar at the base of the diagram) and regular blood samples were taken and analyzed. One\n\nparticular compound in the blood, lactic acid, was found to vary greatly in its concentration as you can see from the graph.\n\nObserve the graph of lactic acid accumulation in the muscles of an athelete and answer the following questions.\n\n(Graph showing varying amount of lactic acid in the muscles)\n\nx - axis $=$ Time in minutes\n\ny - axis $=$ Concentration of lactic acid in blood $\\mathrm { m g } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$\n\n![](images/33cf1e9377080397e3dbc8d68ddb51d7d1062476119bdd4021a4f86fbaa32207.jpg)  \nfig-11: Athlete (Strenous excercise)",

What was the concentration of lactic acid in the blood to start with?   \nb. What was the greatest concentration reached during the experiment?   \nc. If the trend between points C and D were to continue at the same rate, how long might it take for the original lactic acid level to be reached again? (Hint: extend the line CD until it reaches the starting value.)   \nd. What does high level of lactic acid indicate about the condition of respiration?\n\nAccumulation of lactic acid results in muscular pain. If we take walk, brisk walk, slow jogging, running for same distance we feel that there an increase in pain levels this is because of lactic acid accumulation.\n\nIt seems as if the lactic acid was being produced rapidly by the active muscles, and then only gradually removed from the blood after exercise. What is surprising is that the athlete needs a great length of time to recover. The simplest explanation we can produce at-this stage is that the sugar in the working muscles was being changed to lactic acid. The energy stored in lactic acid molecules is less than that in sugar molecules, and if the acid comes from the sugar then the energy released could be used to rebuild ATP from ADP and phosphate.\n\nDuring a 100 m race a well-trained athlete can hold his breath all the time it is not until afterwards that he pants. In this case, the muscles are using the energy released during the anaerobic breakdown of glucose. It is not until afterwards that the athlete obtains the oxygen needed in order to remove the lactic acid. Therefore, when we under-take strenuous exercise we build up what is called an oxygen debt which has to be repaid later. In a longer race athletes have to breathe all the time, so some lactic acid isT removed while they are running, and they can go on for longer before becoming exhausted. The presence of lactic acid in the blood is the mainR cause of muscle fatigue, but if the body is rested for long enough the tiredness goes.",

    "text": "We have found that living things produce carbon dioxide and give out energy. If these processes are caused by an oxidation process, what happens if the oxygen supply is cut off? If human muscles can go on releasing energy when they are short of oxygen, what can cells of other living organisms do?\n\nLet us find out by doing some experiments.\n\n### Some experiments with yeast\n\nTo test this idea we can see whether it is possible to detect any rise in temperature and the production of carbon dioxide, when living organisms are kept away from a supply of oxygen.\n\nYeast grows rapidly if it is supplied with glucose in solution. Indeed, wild yeasts are normally found growing on the skins of fruits like grapes and apples, from which they derive their food supplies. Our immediate problem is to remove the oxygen from the glucose solution and yeast.\n\nArrange the apparatus as shown in fig. 12\n\n1. You can remove dissolved oxygen from glucose solution by heating it for a minute, and then cooling it without shaking. Now put in some yeast; the supply of oxygen from the air can be cut off by pouring one centimetre layer of liquid paraffin on to the mixture.\n\n![](images/1d8e0cda5a9dd7f80917ebaa99ef0bcc810f5704d6ba5f7188c495876a358bfb.jpg)  \nfig-12: Testing for production of heat and $C O _ { 2 }$ under anaerobic respiration\n\n2. If you wish to check that the oxygen has been removed from the mixture, add a few drops of diazine green (Janus Green B) solution to the yeast suspension before you pour the liquid paraffin (wax) over it. This blue dye turns pink when oxygen is in short supply around it.   \n3. Arrange for any gas produced by the yeast to escape through a wash bottle containing bicarbonate/indicator solution (or lime water).\n\nDuring the process of anaerobic respiration some amount of carbondioxide is released. The released carbondioxide passes through the tube and turns lime water milky. We can observe the change in the temperature also during this process out for yourself. You may prefer to carry out the ‘carbon dioxide production’ part of the experiment on a smaller scale, using test tubes. If you do, then warm them to about $3 7 \\mathrm { { } ^ { \\circ } C }$ in order to speed up the test.",

We know that we feel hot after some form of strenuous exercise such as running.\n\nDuring cellular respiration energy is released. Some part of energy is stored in the form of ATP. Some part of energy is utilised in our day to day life activities. And the excess amount of energy is released in the form of heat. But in case of vigorous activity like running we need more amount of energy. For this the rate of respiration is increased. So heat is also released in excess quantity. That’s why we feel warm. If the oxygen is not sufficient during vigorous exersise muscles start anaerobic respiration. Hence, lactic acid is formed. We know that accumulation of lactic acid causes pain in muscle.

Single celled organisms Amoeba or multicellular organisms like Hydra and Planarians roundworms and earthworms obtain oxygen and expel carbon dioxide directly from the body by the process of diffusion. In other multicellular animals special organs are evolved. Animals either terrestrial or aquatic adopted to different types of respiration and possess different types of respiratory organs mostly depending on the habitat in which they live. Body size, availability of water and the type of\n\ntheir circulatory system are some of the reasons for the animals to develop different types of respiratory organs.\n\nThere is tracheal respiratory system in insects like cockroach, grasshopper etc. Tracheal respiratory system consists of series of tubes called trachea. This is divided into fine branches called tracheoles which carry air directly to the cells in the tissues.\n\nSome aquatic animals like fishes have developed special organs for respiration which are known as gills or branchiae. Blood supplied to gills through capillaries which have thin walls where gases are exchanged. This is called branchial respiration. Fish keeps its mouth open and lowers the floor of the oral cavity. As a result water from outside will be drawn into the oral cavity. Now the mouth is closed and the floor of the oral cavity is raised. Water is pushed into the pharynx and is forced to gill pouches through internal branchial apertures. Gill lamellae are bathed with water and gaseous exchange takes place.\n\nRespiration through skin is called cutaneous respiration. Frog an amphibian can respire through cutaneous and pulmonary respiration (through lungs) processes as well as Bucco-Pharyngeal Cavity. Terrestrial animals like reptiles, birds and mammals, respire through lungs. Ask your teacher how crocodiles and dolphins respire?\n\n![](images/34dd13e091fc9fc37fb351301d301c9f4487bf12fe5ae9a7cd84bc0be15d28f6.jpg)  \nfig-14: Leaf as a respiratory organ\n\n![](images/91de427cc9ce3d27029ee742594e625f04c47557097abcfc68ec81f386b518ab.jpg)  \nfig-15: Lenticels on stem",

This is a process of synthesis or an anabolic process which occurs in the chloroplasts.\n\nThe equation below summarizes the photosynthetic process\n\n![](images/3ae4b1d5269f83ad563fc2cbd30f05566b5b8e8e0d1ac64ec4d2de39014d7208.jpg)\n\nAfter balancing the equation\n\n![](images/838e85c1db11567ddba306529ec9b413d4b029dfe01c426580616ec4551768da.jpg)\n\nOnce produced, the sugars can then be used for the process of respiration to provide energy to run all life processes.\n\nRespiration as we know is not just the exchange of gases. It is the process of breakdown of complex food molecules or a catabolic process to produce chemical or potential energy.\n\nThis can be summarized by the equation\n\n$$\n\\left(\\mathrm {C H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O}\\right) \\mathrm {n} + \\mathrm {O} _ {2} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm {C O} _ {2} + \\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} + \\text {E n e r g y}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\mathrm {C} _ {6} \\mathrm {H} _ {1 2} \\mathrm {O} _ {6} + 6 \\mathrm {O} _ {2} \\longrightarrow 6 \\mathrm {C O} _ {2} + 6 \\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} + \\text {E n e r g y}\n$$\n\nPhotosynthesis and respiration appear to be opposing reactions, but both have very different biochemical pathways and are essential for a plant’s metabolism.",

    "text": "By “respiratory system” we usually mean the passages that transport air to the lungs and to the microscopic air sacs in them, called alveoli (where gases are exchanged) and vice versa.\n\nThe term ‘respiration’ refers to the whole chain of processes from the inhalation of air to the use of oxygen in the cells.\n\nLavoisier found that the air that we breathe out precipitated lime water\n\nAir passes from nostrils to nasal cavity to pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi, bronchioles to alveoli and blood and back through the same route.\n\nGas exchange in the lungs takes place in the tiny air sacs called alveoli in the lungs. The lungs have millions of alveoli and each lies in contact with capillaries.\n\nDiaphragm is a muscular tissue present at the floor of the chest cavity.\n\nDuring inspiration (inhalation) the volume of the chest cavity is increased as the diaphragm contracts and dome flattens out, its internal pressure decreases and the air from the outside rushes into the lungs.\n\nDuring expiration, the chest wall is lowered and moves inward, and the diaphragm relaxes and assumes its dome shape. These changes increase the pressure on the lungs; their elastic tissue contracts and squeezes the air out through the nose to the external atmosphere.\n\nAir is filtered in the nasal cavity and the whole length of the trachea.\n\nThe moist surface of the lining of the nasal cavity, and the hairs growing from its sides, remove some of the tiny particles of dirt in the air. In addition, as the inhaled air passes through the nasal cavity, its temperature is brought close to that of the body, and it takes up water vapour. So that it becomes more moist than before.\n\nPharynx is a common passage of digestive and respiratory system. Epiglottis, a flap like muscular valve controls movement of air and food towards their respective passages.\n\nLarynx is a stiff box like structure containing our vocal cords. When air passes out of the lungs and over the vocal cords, it causes them to vibrate. This produces sounds on the basis of our speech, song etc.\n\nTrachea is the wind pipe channeling air to lungs.\n\nAt its lower end the trachea or the wind pipe divides into two bronchi-one leading to each lung.\n\nThe bronchi divide into smaller and smaller branches called bronchioles.",

    "text": "It is wonder to know that only human beings have to learn how to breath. Our lungs are divided into lobes. At each breath we will inhale or exhale only $5 0 0 \\mathrm { m l }$ of air. Where as our lung capacity is approximately $5 8 0 0 \\mathrm { m l }$ . So most of the time breathing takes place in the upper lobes only. This means we are not using our lungs to their fullest capacity. Even after complete expiration approximately 1200ml of air remains in our lungs. So we can make use of $4 6 0 0 \\mathrm { m l }$ of lung capacity for breathing. Think what changes are required to inhale that much air.\n\n![](images/b653ba5520925ec13f4601af148bb94eb06410b02c3d731bd88944788051742a.jpg)\n\nThe Indian ayurvedic physician. Patanjali developed a scientific breathing practice called Yogabhyasa. Maharshi Patanjali proposed a theory called Astanga yoga. He was introduced 195 yogic principles in eight divisions. 1. Yama (Social disipline), 2. Niyama (Individual discipline), 3. Asana (Body posture), 4. Pranayama (Expansion of vital energy), 5. Prathyahara (With drawal of senses), 6. Dharana (Consentration), 7. Dhyana (Meditation), 8. Samadi (Self realisation).\n\nThe art of breathing in Yogabyasa is called Pranayama prana means gas, ayama means journey. In Pranayama practice air is allowed to enterT three lobes of lungs inorder to increase the amount of oxygen to diffuse into blood. Deep breaths in Pranayama helps us to reduce breathings perR minute form 20-22 to 15. Because of these deep breaths more amount of oxygen available to brain and tissues of the body will be more active. It is very important to practice Pranayama regularly to make our life healthy and active. All people irrespective of age and sex should practice Pranayama under the guidance of well trained Yoga Teacher to improve the workingC capacity of lungs.",

    "text": "Let us study how we came to know about the structure and functions of the blood vessels.\n\nIt was not until $1 6 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century that we really came to know how our blood vessels functioned. In 1574, an Italian doctor, Girolamo Fabrici, was studying the veins in the leg. He noticed that they had small valves in them. If the blood moved in one direction, the valves folded towards the walls of the vessel, so that the blood could pass without trouble. If the blood moved in the opposite direction, the valves closed.\n\nThis meant they are one-way valves. The valves permitted the blood to move even when a person is standing upright. But not move downward.\n\nWhen a person moves his legs, or just tightens his leg muscles, those muscles squeeze the veins and force the blood in those veins to move upward against the pull of gravity (because that’s the only way to go). If a person keeps his leg muscles relaxed, the blood isn’t moving much, but at least it isn’t being pulled down by gravity. The valves won’t allow that.\n\nEveryone thought that the blood leaving the left ventricle always movedT away from the heart for which Fabrici paid no attention. He missed the importance of his own discovery. But then, William Harvey (1578-1657), an Englishman who, after he became a doctor, went to Italy for further education and studied under Fabrici.\n\n![](images/4cf174cb9ec54cb7b4612390dbf90cc19eb3d2aa64107e9a944bda5f8643fd97.jpg)  \nfig-6: William Harvey\n\nHarvey dissected the hearts of dead people and studied the valves between each atrium and its ventricle. He noticed that they were oneway valves. They allowed the blood to flow from the atrium to the ventricle without any hinderance.\n\nWhen the heart contracted, however, no blood in the ventricle could flow back into the atrium. Instead, all the blood was pushed out into the arteries.\n\nHarvey began thinking about the valves his teacher, Fabrici, had discovered in the leg veins. They were one-way, and they forced the blood to move toward the heart.",

As though the blood as trying to flow toward the heart and to accumulate just below the block because it simply couldn’t flow away from the heart. This was true of all veins.\n\nIn the arteries, the blood bulged on the heart side of any block he put in, as though it were trying to flow away from the heart and couldn’t move in the other direction.\n\nHarvey now saw what was happening. The heart pushed blood into the arteries, and the blood returned by way of the veins. It did this for both ventricles. The blood had a double circulation. If one started from the right ventricle, it left by way of the arteries to the lungs, and returned by way of the veins to the left atrium is known as pulmonary circulation and from there into the left Ventricle.From the left ventricle, it left by way of the arteries to the rest of the body and returned (in a “greater circulation”) by way of the veins to the right atrium and from there into the right ventricle. It is known as systemic circulation. As the blood reaches the heart two times, once through pulmonary cycle and again through systemic cycle, it is called double circulation.\n\nHarvey also showed that it was impossible, suppose that the blood was used up in the body and that new blood was formed. He measured how much blood the heart pumped in one contraction and also counted the number of contractions.\n\nHe found that in one hour, the heart pumped out a quantity of blood that was three times the weight of a man. The body couldn’t use up blood and form new blood at such a rate. The same blood had to circulate and be used over and over again.T\n\nHarvey still had some problem. The smallest arteries and veins that could be seen had to be connected by vessels too small to see.

    "text": "The human heart starts beating around $2 1 ^ { \\mathrm { s t } }$ day during the embryonic development (refer reproduction chapter). If it stops beating, it results in the death of a person.\n\nOne contraction and one relaxation of atria and ventricles is called one cardiac cycle.\n\n1. We start with the imagination that all the four chambers of the heart are in relaxed state (diastole).   \n2. Blood from venacava and pulmonary veins enters the right and left atria respectively.   \n3. Now the atria contract, forcing the blood to enter into the ventricles.   \n4. When the ventricles are filled with blood they start contracting and atria start relaxing. The aperture between the atria and ventricles is closed by valves. On ventricular contraction due to pressure the blood moves into the aorta and pulmonary artery. When the valves are closed forcibly, we can listen to the first sharp sound of the heart lub.   \n5. When the ventricles start relaxing the pressure in the ventricles is reduced. The blood which has entered the arteries tries to come back into the ventricles. The valves which are present in the blood vessels are closed to prevent backward flow of blood into the ventricles. Now we can listen to a dull sound of the heart dub. The atria are filled up with blood and are ready to pump the blood into the ventricles.\n\nThe sequential events in the heart which are cyclically repeated are called cardiac cycle. The cardiac cycle includes an active phase systole and a resting phase the diastole of atria and ventricles.\n\nThe time needed for atrial contraction (atrial systole) is 0.11- 0.14 seconds. The time needed for ventricular contraction (ventricular systole) is 0.27-0.35 seconds. The time needed for relaxation of both auricles and ventriculars i.e. joint diastole is about 0.4 seconds. The whole process is completed in approximately 0.8 seconds.\n\nHence, naturally the blood is pumped into the blood vessels at regular intervals. The tissues will not receive the blood continuously, but in the form of spurts. When we keep our finger at the wrist, where the artery is passing into the hand we feel the pressure of blood moving in it. This is the pulse. The rate of the pulse will be equal to the number of heart beats.",

In elders it will be clear that the lower part of the legs will be swollen. This stage is called edema.\n\nWhy do our legs swell?\n\nAs blood flows through tissues and through blood capillaries some amount of fluids and certain solid materials are constantly flowing out of them at different junctions. Such materials are to be collected and sent back into blood circulation.\n\nWe know that blood circulates in the blood vessels, pushed by the heart. From the heart it flows into the arteries and finally into the capillaries. To supply nutrients to the cells (tissues), the liquid portion of the blood with nutrients flows out of the capillaries. This is called tissue fluid.\n\nThe tissue fluid which is present in the tissues should be transported into the blood vessels again. Some portion of the tissue fluid enters into the venules, which in turn form the veins, which carry blood to the heart. What about the remaining tissue fluid? To transport the tissue fluid in to the main blood stream, a separate system is present. That is called lymphatic system. In latin lymph means water.\n\nLymph is the vital link between blood and tissues by which essential substances pass from blood to cells and excretory products from cells to blood. The lymphatic system is a parallel system to venous system which collects tissue fluid from tissues and transports it to the venous system.\n\n![](images/1a08fbe962b69d275e99ee71e156a2645ca4e9b3aae7da723706d3f2845b0708.jpg)  \nfig-12: Lymphatic system\n\nBlood is a substance which contains solid and liquid particles. Lymph is the substance that contains blood without solid particles. Tissue fluid is lymph present in the tissues. The liquid portion after formation of blood clot is serum.\n\nThe muscles which are attached to the skeleton (skeletal muscles) act as pumps when they contract and help in pushing the lymph flowing in lymphatic vessels and the blood flowing in veins towards the heart.\n\nThe valves that are present in the lymphatic vessels and veins stop the reverse flow of blood.

    "text": "When the unicellular organisms separated themselves from the sea with the formation of the limiting membrane, the problem of transportation arose. The nature has found the solution, by creating a microscopic ocean which has its own currents.\n\nIn unicellular organisms like Amoeba the protoplasm shows natural movements. These movements are called Brownian movements, because of which the nutrients and oxygen are distributed throughout the protoplasm equally.\n\nThis simplest intracellular transportation system, present in unicellular animals has been retained in multicellular animals including humans. The protoplasm of any cell in our body is mobile and protoplasmic currents exist even in the nerve cells.\n\nThe multicellular animals have to develop more complicated system for transportation of materials.\n\nThe parazoans like sponges, use sea water for transportation. Since the natural water currents are not reliable, the sponges create their own currents by beating of flagella that are present in their body.\n\nThe cnidarians which are better evolved than sponges (e.g. Hydra and jelly fish) have developed blind sac like gastrovascular cavity, which has taken up the function of digestion and transportation of nutrients to each and every cell of the body.\n\nIn platyhelmenthes (e.g. Fasciola hepatica), the digestive system is highly branched and supplies digested food to all the cells directly. In these animals the excretory system collects wastes from each cell individually. In these organisms most of the body is occupied by digestive and excretory systems.\n\nIn animals belonging to Nemathelminthes (round worms), the pseudocoelom has taken up the function of collection and distribution of materials.\n\nThe Annelids, the first Eucoelomate animals have developed a pulsatile vessel, to move the fluid and the transporting medium is blood.\n\nThe Arthropods have developed a pulsatile organ to pump the blood, the heart. The blood instead of flowing in blood vessels floods the tissues, directly supplying the nutrients to the tissues. Oxygen is directly supplied to the tissues directly by the respiratory system.\n\nSuch type of transportation system which supplies nutrients to the tissues directly is called open type of circulatory system.eg.

Now we will discuss some other points related to blood.\n\nGenerally you have heard the word B.P. What is B.P.? To move the blood through this network of vessels, a great deal of force is required. The force is provided by the heart and is at its highest when the ventricles\n\ncontract, forcing the blood out of the heart and into the arteries. Then there is a drop in the pressure as the ventricles refill with blood for the next beat.\n\nB.P. is always measured in the upper arm artery. B.P. varies throughout the body, so a standard place must be used so that a person’s blood pressure can be compared over a period of time. Doctors measure the blood pressure (B.P.) with a device called sphygmomanometer.\n\nThere are two pressure readings. One measures the strongest pressure during the time blood is forced out of the ventricles. This is called systolic pressure.

People who have high B.P. during resting period are said to have hypertension. Discuss with your teacher about low blood pressure.",

Observe the mass of fine threads coming from the seed by hand lens. These are roots. They have fine microscopic structures called root hairs. These are root hairs through which water enters the plant. Gently squash a portion of the root hair between slide and cover slip in a drop of water and examine under a microscope. Note the thinness of the walls of root hairs. It is not completely understood how the water enters the root hairs and passes inwards from cell to cell until it gets into the xylem vessels,\n\nbut there is no doubt that osmosis plays an important role.(IX class plasmamembrane)\n\nEvery living cell acts as an osmotic system, the cytoplasm lining of the cell wall acts as the semipermeable membrane. Observe the following figure, notice how do roots penetrate into soil? You will find that the root hairs grow out into the spaces between the soil particles and that the hairs are surrounded by moisture.\n\n![](images/8457e28a2a6a9d3bfcd63084914d4c7be30ba31a8ef6c975d69173fe3617d300.jpg)  \nfig-16: L.S of root showing relationship of root hair and soil water\n\nNote: In fig-16 Arrow marks shows the direction of flow of water.\n\nThe soil water is an extremely dilute solution of salts. Soil water concentration is more dilute than that of the cell sap in the root hair; therefore water will pass into the vacuole of the root hair by osmosis. Recall the process of osmosis that you have learnt in the chapter “moving of substances through plasma membrane” in class IX. The entry of water dilutes the contents of the root hair vacuole so that it becomes more dilute than it’s neighbouring cell.\n\nSo, water passes into the neighbouring cell which in turn becomes diluted, finally water enters the xylem vessels. As there are vast number of root hairs and root cells involved, a pressure in the xylem vessels develops which forces the water upwards. This total pressure is known as root pressure. Root pressure is not the main cause of movement of water in xylem but it is certainly one of the factor. The other factors are also there.

Where do these water droplets or water vapour come from?\n\n![](images/1939a33ff96aa9b545d777c48d04a7bb660023f3f9b24c3b336f81e3e0520c8e.jpg)  \nfig-18: Transpiration\n\nWe know that this type of evaporation of water through leaves is called transpiration. Water evaporates through stomata of leaves and lenticels of stem.\n\nWhen the leaves transpire, there is a pulling effect on the continuous columns of water in the xylem vessels. The top ends of these vessels are surrounded by the leaf’s mesophyll cells which contain cell sap, so the water is continuous from the xylem vessels to the walls of the mesophyll cells from which it evaporates into the air spaces causing the pull. The water column does not break because of its continuous molecular attraction. This is a property of water you demonstrate every time you drink through a straw.\n\nNow we have a picture of the water-conducting system of a tree. Water is absorbed by osmosis from the soil by\n\nthe root hairs. This is passed into the xylem vessels which form a continuous system of tubes through root and stem into the leaves. Here the water evaporates and releases into the atmosphere. The evaporation creates the main pull of water above root pressure which gives a variable and minor push from below. This results in a continuous column of moving water, the ‘transpiration stream’.\n\nIs there any relation between transpiration and rain fall?\n\nThe amount of water passing through a plant is often considerable. For example, an oak tree can transpire as much as 900 liters of water per day. It follows therefore that areas of forest significantly affect the degree of saturation of the air above them, so that when air currents bring air which is already nearly saturated to a forest area, it becomes fully saturated and comes down as rain; this is why forest areas often have a higher rainfall than areas nearby.",

The following experiments provide evidence that food is transported in the phloem cells.\n\nPhloem sieve tubes are extremely small and theN analysis of their contents is not easy. Biologists studied about food transportation in plants with the help of aphids (greenfly). When you see aphids clustering round the young stems of plants as they feed on the plant juices. To obtain this juice an aphidG pierces the plant tissues with its long needle like organ “proboscis”. It can be shown when a feeding aphid is killed and the stem carefully sectioned, the proboscisN only penetrates upto a phloem sieve tube. This\n\nproboscis also provides a ready-made means of obtaining the juice for analysis! The experiment can be done in this way. An aphid is killed while in the act of feeding and the body is then carefully cut away, leaving the hollow proboscis still inserted into the phloem. It is found that because the contents of the phloem sieve tubes are under slight pressure the fluid slowly exudes from the cut end of the proboscis in the form of drops; these drops are then collected and analysed. The fluid is found to contain sugars and amino acids.T\n\nNot surprisingly, aphids absorb so much sugar from the phloem that they cannot assimilate all of it and it excretes out of the body as a sticky syrup called honey dew. Leaves which have been attacked by aphids oftenT feel sticky as a result of honey dew.\n\n![](images/1bd7678f48aef266f74b23347f8277cbdd5c156543f300ece1e6409017fac33d.jpg)  \nfig-20: Removing ring of bark (Ringing experiment)\n\nYou may notice that sometimes barks of the tree damaged more than a half, even then the tree is alive.

Remove all tissues from the center outwards, including the phloem. After a few days, when the tissues above and below the\n\nring were analyzed it was shown that food had accumulated above the ring, but was not present below it. If it is left for some more time, the stem increases in thickness immediately above the ring, but no growth occurred\n\nbelow it. So, any damage to the phloem all around the stem will prevent the food from passing down to the roots and the tree will eventually die. This is a fact of great economic importance because certain mammals scratching the bark of trees to get the food stored in the phloem, especially during hard winters when food is scarce. Voles (rat like rodents) do this to young saplings at ground level and rabbits can do much damage to older ones. Foresters find it economically worthwhile to enclose new plantations with wire netting to prevent rabbits from entering.\n\nForesters also encourage predators such as foxes, badgers, hawks and owls as they help to keep down the population of voles and rabbits. Grey squirrels too do great damage, particularly Casurina crop grown at beech and seashore, and for this reason, in some parts it is impossible to grow these trees as a crop. Observe barks of trees in your surroundings for evidence of bark having been gnawed off saplings and trees. Note the species of tree, the position of the damage, whether the damage is recent or old, and the size of tooth marks if these are visible. From these observations you could find out which species had caused the damage. Also look out for the effect of such damage on the tree as a whole.",

    "text": "There is another antigen of red blood cells which is present in $8 5 \\%$ of the people of Britain, this is known as the Rhesus factor, as it was first discovered in Rhesus monkeys. People who have this are said to be Rhesus positive $( \\mathbb { R } \\mathbf { h } + )$ . Those who do not have this factor are termed Rhesus negative (Rh-). Normally they do not carry an antibody to this factor in their plasma. However, if Rh+ blood is transfused into the blood of a Rh- person, against Rh-factors will be formed and these are capable of destroying $\\mathrm { R h + }$ red cells. Under certain circumstances this is a potential hazard for babies.\n\nIf a $\\mathrm { R h + }$ man marries a Rh- woman, some of the children are likely to be $\\mathrm { R h + }$ . At birth there is always some mixing of blood between the circulation of mother and baby and this may occasionally happen during pregnancy. So, if a child is $\\mathrm { R h + }$ some of its blood will leak into its mother’s circulation and cause antibodies to form in her blood. If the mother has more children, not all will necessarily be $\\mathrm { R h + }$ , but if they are, the amount of antibodies in her blood often increases with each pregnancy, and in some instances the antibodies in her blood may pass into the baby’s blood in sufficient quantities to produce very serious anaemia and even death. Fortunately these cases are not frequent, and when they do occur, the baby is given a complete transfusion soon after birth so that the baby’s blood is replaced by blood containing no antibodies to the rhesus factor. It is now possible for this transfusion to be carrried out before birth. Another recently developed technique is for the mother to be given an injection shortly after the birth of her first child which prevents the $\\mathrm { R h + }$ cells from stimulating the production of the harmful antibody.",

Each kidney is convex on the outer side and concave on theA inner side. The position of the right kidney is lower than the left kidney due to the presence of liver above.\n\nLet us recall the last question in your lab activity.

You are aware that a variety of end products are formed during metabolism and these nitrogenous wastes are important. Plants does not have specific organs to excrete these wastes. Plants break down waste substances at much slower rate than in animals. Hence accumulation of waste is also much slower. Green plants in darkness and plants that do not possess chlorophyll produce carbon dioxide and water as respiratory waste products. Oxygen itself can be considered as a waste product generated during photosynthesis, that exits out side through stomata of leaves and lenticels of stem.\n\nHow do the plants manage or send out waste products from its body?\n\nPlants can get rid of excess water by a process like transpiration and guttation. Waste products may be stored in leaves, bark, and fruits. When these dead leaves, bark, and ripe fruits fall off from the tree then waste products in them are get rid off. Waste gets stored in the fruits in the form of solid bodies called Raphides. However several compounds are synthesized by the plants for their own use especially for defence. Many plants synthesize chemicals and store them in roots, leaves, seeds, etc., for protection against herbivores. Most of the chemicals are unpleasant to taste. Hence, herbivores usually do not prefer to eat such plants. Some of the chemicals are toxic and may even kill the animal that eats them.",

Ex: Parthenium.\n\nDo roots secrete?\n\n‘Brugman’ a botanist proved from his experiments that the roots not only absorb fluid from soil, but returns a portion of their peculiar secretions back into it. We can see such instances in plants like apple where a single apple crop for 4 or 5 years continuously in the same soil, that fail to produce fruits. It will not give proper yield even if you use lot of fertilizers.\n\nDo you think there is any relation between reduction in yielding and root secretions?\n\nWhy do we get peculiar smell when you shift the potted plants?",

Excretion is the removal of materials from a living being, while secretion is movement of material from one point to other point. So secretion is active while excretion is passive in nature. Humans excrete materials such as tears, urine, Carbon dioxide, and sweat while secretion on other hand, includes enzymes, hormones, and saliva. In plants too we find excretion through roots into its surroundings and falling off leaves and bark. Secretions occur in the plant body in form of latex, resins, gums etc.\n\n![](images/ed0fe9e1dd542f8304e82b061a516af7ac0e9820151a8bf9a635ef1211e6102f.jpg)",

    "text": "Due to metabolism several harmful excretory products are formed and process of removing toxic waste from the body is called execretion.\n\nThe human excretory system comprises a pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters, urinary bladder, urethra.\n\nEach kidney is composed of approximately 1.3 to 1.8 millions of uriniferous tubules or nephrons, which are structural and functional units of kidney.\n\nA nephron comprises glomerulus,bowman’s capsule, proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), Henle’s loop, Distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule.\n\nFormation of urine involves four stages. 1) Glomerular filteration, 2) Tubular Reabsorption, 3) Tubular Secretion, 4) Concentration of Urine.\n\nKidneys remove nitrogenous waste from body, maintains water balance (osmoregulation), salt content, pH, and blood pressure in human body.\n\nDialysis machine is an artificial kidney which filters the blood to remove the metabolic wastes out side the body.\n\nKidney transplantation is a permanent solution to renal failure patients.\n\nDifferent animals have different excretory organs e.g. amoeba-contractile vacuole, platyhelminthesflame cells, annelida-nephridia, arthropoda-malpighian tubule, reptiles, birds and mammals-kidney.\n\nThere are no special organs for excretion in plants. Plants store different waste materials in leaves, bark, roots, seeds which fall of from the plants.\n\nPlant metabolites are two types i) primary metabolites eg: proteins carbohydrates and fats. ii) secondary metabolites eg: alkoloids, gums, tannins, latex and resins. These are economically importanttannins, to us.\n\nExcretion is the removal of material from living beings where as secretion is movement of materials from one point to other.",

In Hyderabad where there are kidney transplantation facilities minimum 25 patients per hospital are waiting for kidney donors. Daily 10 - 100 people met with accident in our State. Out of them some people get brain dead. If we collect organs from brain dead patients in time, we can save minimum 5 peoples’ life. But lack of awareness on organ donation those who are willing to donate organs and those who need organs do not get proper information even facilities are there. Medical personnels from government and private hospitals are not informing about brain dead Patients. If they inform in appropriate time it will be very useful to patients those who are waiting for organ donation. In Hyderabad, organ Transplantation facility is available only in two government hospitals (NIMS and Osmonia) and in more than 10 corporate hospitals. Other organs like cornea transplant organs like kidney, liver, heart, lungs, pancreas, skin, bone, intestines and eye (cornea) can transplanted from brain dead patients.The process of transplantation of organs from brain dead patients to another is called cadaver transplantation. If any person is willing to donate organs or in needy get organs. They must register their names in transplantation facility hospitals.\n\nCollect information about a voluntary organisation working on organ donation and make a report.\n\nThere is very less awareness among people about organ donation. Society needs much awareness in organ donation, so that we can save many lives who are in need of different organs from donars for their survival. Instead of living in their memories, let us give them a chance to live in others for one more life.\n\nWe can live even after death",

    "text": "Sharpening of a pencil, grasping a door knob, walking or running, driving, and a few physical actions, all involve well coordinated movements made with well balanced postures. In fact, whenever we move the three basic functions, such as movement, balance and coordination work together to perform purposeful motions of body parts. This is actually quite a feat, because moving is a complex process for the body.\n\nEven standing upright is a difficult challenge of balancing on just two feet with a narrow base. Yet, it is common for us not only to stand upright easily and apparently, effortlessly, but also while keeping our balance to perform many other functions.\n\nWhat other functions do you think needed in coordination and balance?\n\nAll our functions are carried out by an effort of several systems working together. For example, while movement, we hardly ever use just the skeletal system or muscular system alone, several other systems also have their own roles to play. Even within the muscular system, several muscles work in a sequence or at once.\n\nWhat triggers movement of the muscles?\n\nAll our body organs, tissues and cells work together systematically. All of them pick up signals of change from their surroundings and respond to them. This process triggers different functions in our body as well as by our body. For example, it is natural to move to a side of the road when we hear or see a car approaching.\n\nHow do we respond so fast according to situation?",

The cat may be running because it saw a mouse. Plants grow towards the sunlight. We start sweating when it is hot and humid.\n\nThe ability to react to particular stimulus in a particular situation must be of great importance in ensuring the survival of the organism.\n\nThere is a sequence of events that brings about responses. They start from detecting changes in environment (both external and internal) or stimuli, transmission of the information, processing of the same. Finally the response will detect and execute the appropriate action.\n\nLet us do the following activity to find more about response to stimuli.",

    "text": "The Greeks believed that all functions of the body were controlled by the brain since damage to that organ produced remarkable changes in behaviour. They had very little idea on how such control could be exercised Though Galen, a Greek physiologist (A.D. 129-200) made one notable observation. One of his patients, having suffered a blow on the neck when falling from his chariot, complained loss of feeling in the arm while still retaining normal muscular control of its moment. Galen concluded that nerves were of two kinds – those of sensation and those of action. According to him the blow in the neck had damaged the nerves of sensation but had not affected it’s action.\n\nWhy do you think Galen draw such a conclusion?\n\nThe functioning of nerves as integrating systems was little known till late $1 8 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century. Then, physiologists began to study the mechanism of nerve functioning and found how signals were transmitted by making the connection between recent work on electricity and the propositions on working of the nervous system made till then.\n\nNow we know more about how nerves from different sections of the brain and spinal cord control responses of different areas of the body. We also know the probable pathways that transmit information but we still know very little about the working mechanisms of the nerve cell.",

There are fine projections mainly of two types extending from the cell body of the nerve cell. The small projections are dendrites while a long one that extends to different parts of our body is called Axon. The axon is surrounded by a specialized insulatory sheath called myelin sheath.This sheath is interrupted at regular intervals called nodes of ranvier.The myelin sheath is made up of schwann cells and chiefly consists of fatty material. Axons not having the sheath are non-myelinated\n\nfibers. The covering also forms a partition between adjacent axons. The nerve cell body lies either in our brain or spinal cord or very close to the spinal cord in a region called dorsal or ventral root ganglion. In the brain or spinal cord, it is difficult to make out the difference between dendrites and axons on the basis of their length, often, the presence of the sheath helps us to find out but several axons here do not have the sheath.\n\nWe know that the nerve cell is the structural and functional unit of nervous system. Our nervous system consists of more than100 billion of them, which communicate with each other in a specific manner. Dendrites of one nerve cell connect to the other or to the axons of the other nerve cell through connections called as a ‘synapse’.\n\nSynapse is the functional region of contact between two neurons, where information from one neuron is transmitted or relayed to another neuron.\n\n![](images/b20ca6b766a60626592c3b22dfb9e4fa84141b9b14424d8f077f0b9a0b34213c.jpg)  \nfig-4: Synapse",

Clearly a nerve pathway was involved.\n\nDuring actions which are involuntary and have to be carried out in very short intervals of time, the pathway that nerves follow is a short one; it does not go up to the brain while voluntary pathways are usually longer passing through the brain.

The myelinated axons leave the spinal cord from both sides of the vertebral column.

Animals were shown to have the ability to respond to stimuli even when the brain was removed. ‘Leonardo da Vinci’ (1452-1519) and ‘Stephen Hales’ (1677-1771) both recorded the survival of frogs whose brain had been destroyed. The animal still produced muscular movements if its skin was pinched or pricked. Both observers further recorded that the animal died as soon as spinal cord was damaged by pushing a needle down it.\n\nSuch evidence suggested that the spinal cord was not simply a trunk road for instructions from the brain, but might be a control center in its own right.T\n\nAccording to you what would be the function of the spinal cord?\n\nAre all functions of our body under direct control of the brain and spinal cord?

It has voluntary control of muscles of some areas of skin and the skeletal muscle.\n\nWe can take up an example to see how certain involuntary function controlled by autonmous nervous system takes place in our body. A very evident observation is the reduction and expansion of the pupil of our eye.\n\nWhen we enter a dark room we cannot see anything immediately. Slowly we are able to see the things around us in the room. This is because of increase in diameter of pupil, which allows more light in. When we come out of the dark room into broad day light the diameter of the pupil decreases allowing less light to enter into the eyes. Both these functions occur under the influence of the autonomous nervous system.",

    "text": "Research in the past two decades has brought out an interesting fact. Other than central nervous system and peripheral nervous system, there is a system of neurons present in our digestive tract that can function even independently of either CNS or PNS. It has been nick named as a second brain and the system is called as enteric nervous system (ENS).\n\nYou know that medulla oblongata is the region that regulates heartbeat, breathing etc. the system that helps to bring about such activities of internal organs is called autonomous nervous system. Normally such involuntary activities take place by the coordinated efforts of the medulla oblongata and autonomous nervous system.\n\n![](images/7270f1cbe18040c2c337bd9195cb8afcc4f51a33a88f764961f29cd06b226c97.jpg)  \nfig-14: Autonomous nervous system\n\nNow let us see how the autonomous nervous system influences the life activities. Observe the fig-14 and record your observations.\n\nTo which organs of the body do the nerves go from the ganglions near the vertebral column?\n\nWhat are the organs that receives nerves starting from the brain? Which are the organs whose activities are influenced by the sympathetic system?\n\nWhich are the organs whose activities are influenced by the para sympathetic system?\n\nWhat do you understand about the functions of para sympathetic system?\n\nWhat do you understand about the functions of sympathetic system?\n\nGanglia near the vertebral column are connected to the spinal cord by nerves. The sympathetic system is formed by the chain of ganglia on either sides of the vertebral column and the associated nerves. The para sympathetic system is formed by the nerves arising from the ganglia of the brain and the posterior part of the spinal cord. These together constitute the autonomous nervous system. It is the part of the peripheral nervous system consisting of twelve pairs of cranial nerves and thirty one pairs of spinal nerves.\n\nSeveral functions in our body are controlled by nerves while many of them and others are controlled by other ways as well. You might have heard about people having diabetes and know that they have to take tablets or insulin injections when the level of sugar in their blood rises.Let’s find out what insulin is and how we came to know about it. This would also give us an idea of controls other than nerves in our body.",

    "text": "In 1868 Paul Langerhans, Professor of Pathology at the University of Freiburg in Germany, working on the structure of the pancreas, noted certain patches of cells quite different in appearance from the normal tissue cells of the organ and richly supplied with blood vessels. They are known Islets of Langerhans (Islets stands for islands), but their function remained unknown. Many others interested in the function of pancreas and found that its removal from the body of an experimental animal would lead to the development of diseases similar to a well-known human ailment ‘sugar diabetes’. This is a condition in which the amount of free sugar in the blood and in the urine is abnormally high. It’s a cause in man was unknown but evidence pointed to the pancreas as a possible role.\n\n![](images/d51a18743a4ff864387501a878dabf832cf273760e28e1f66fad6e8c9287313f.jpg)  \nfig-15: Pancreas\n\n![](images/0cbc0257882bdb78c9885dbda16fce01b2ddf4fc5b69dfc540962190f301b878.jpg)  \nfig-16: Paul Langerhans\n\nThe next stage was reached when it was found that tying up the pancreatic duct that emerged from the duodenum( a part of the small intestine) would cause the pancreas to degenerate but the Islets of Langerhans would remain normal. Moreover, an animal so treated would not develop diabetes. This was really a strong evidence that the level of blood sugar is linked with the islet cells. By 1912, workers were convinced that the islets produced a secretion which directly liberated into the blood. In Latin ‘insula’ means an island. The name insulin was coined for the secretion, even though it had not been isolated.\n\nTen years later in Toronto, Banting, Best, and Macleod finally succeeded in extracting insulin from degenerate animal pancrease whose ducts to the intestine had been tied. When given by intravenous injection to a dog with no pancreas, this substance kept it alive and healthy with a low level of blood sugar. Insulin is now produced in large quantities for the treatment of human sufferers from sugar diabetes, to whom it is administered by injection into the skin.\n\nInsulin thus is a chemical that acts as it reaches blood from the cells that produce it.",

    "text": "The evidence that events occurring in one part of the body could be affected and indeed controlled by substances circulating in the blood was now overwhelming. In 1905 the English physiologist Starling had coined the term hormone (Greek, hormao – to impel) for such secretions. The glands secreting hormones were termed ductless glands, since they have no tube or duct to carry away their products, which pass straight into the blood. In this way they differ from glands such as the liver and pancreas, whose secretions pass down ducts which are connected to other organs.\n\nThe human body contains many other ductless glands (endocrine glands).Glands do not produce their hormones at a steady rate. The adrenal gland, for example, normally has a low output.\n\n![](images/e462a4d09a31f451aa7c0ca29fa44ed5304295b1b6f4c2922ec746a52251183e.jpg)  \nfig-17: Cock fight\n\nWhat will you do if a dog is after you? What will be your first reaction? Have you ever observed any change in your body when you are afraid?\n\nNobody wants to fight with a dog. The first thing we do is running away from the place.\n\nTry to note the body language of humans / animals when they are fighting / scared.\n\nIf we observe our body, when we are afraid, the rate of heart beat increases; the breath rate will be\n\nfaster; blood pressure increases; the hair on the body becomes erect and we get goose bumps. The other things we might not observe are pupil dilation, skin becomes more sensitive, and rarely the bladder and the rectum may be emptied. We come to normal state only after we reach a safe spot.\n\nWe have already studied about nerve co-ordination, where nerves carry stimuli from sense organs to central nervous system and orders to effectors organs-the muscles. But, in the above situation the action of the nervous system is limited. All the changes in the body are carried out under the influence of a chemical called ‘Adrenalin’ hormone, released by Adrenal gland which is an endocrine gland. The various actions of the body are controlled by hormones and co-ordinated by nervous system. So in this type of conditions nervous system and endocrine system work together to bring about control and co-ordination.\n\nAsk your teacher why Adrenalin hormone is also called fight or flight hormone.",

You know that increased levels of adrenalin are responsible for anxiety. When the levels of adrenalin in the blood come down slowly we come to normal state. If the adrenalin levels persist for a longer period of time, regular metabolic activities are disturbed.\n\nIncrease in adrenalin levels leads to anger, decrease in adrenalin levels leads to normal position.\n\nWhat will happen if it is continued for longer periods of time?\n\nSimilarly the sugar levels in the blood rise than normal level, they are detected by the cells of pancreas, which respond by producing more insulin into the blood.

Due to water pressure pulvini hold the leaf erect. Touch me not plant shows nastic movement by touch. This is called thigmonasty. When we touch the leaves, an electrical impulse is generated. This impulse acts on plant hormone. Because of this hormone water in the pulvini cells which are closer to the leaf vein migrate to other side of the cells.Then pulvini loss its firmness hence leaves become fold. After 20 to 30 minutes water comes back pulvini attains firmness and leaves become erect.\n\nYou might have observed the tendrils of plants growing towards a support. Can you imagine how is it happening? Would you think it is responding to a stimulus?\n\nBoth plants and animals react to various stimuli around them. But the method of responding to stimuli is not similar in plants and animals. Higher animals respond to stimuli because they have a nervous system and an endocrine system. Plants do not have a well-defined nervous or endocrine system. They do have some mechanism of control by means of some chemicals or hormones.\n\nPlants can sense the presence of stimuli like light, heat, water, touch, pressure, chemicals, gravity etc. The hormones present in the plants called phytohormones (phyto means plant) control responses towards the stimuli mentioned above. Phytohormones coordinate the activities of the plant usually by controlling one or the other aspect of the growth of the plant. So plant hormones are also called growth substances.

They stated that when seedlings are freely exposed to a lateral light some ‘influence’ is transmitted from upper to the lower part causing the material to bend.\n\nIn 1926, the Dutch plant physiologist F.W. Went succeeded in separating this ‘influence’ from the plant fig-20: Elong that produced it. Went cut off coleoptile tips from oat seedlings. He placed the tips on a slice of agar and left them for about an hour. He then cut the agar into small blocks and placed a block on one side each stump of the decapitated plants. They were kept in the dark during the entire experiment. Within one hour he observed a distinct bending away from the side on which the agar block was placed.\n\nAgar block that had not been in contact with coleoptile tip produced either no bending or only a slight bending toward the side on which the block had been placed.\n\nWent interpreted these experiments as showing that",

    "text": "The above experiments show that movement of individual parts of plants is possible when they are subjected to external stimuli. This type of\n\nresponse is called tropism or tropic movement. Sometimes the direction of stimuli determines direction of movement, sometimes the direction of movement may not be determined by direction of stimuli. This type of response is called nastic movement.\n\nLet us observe the growth of a creeper plant near window. The shoots of creeper bend towards sunlight. Such type of response of a plant to light is called photo tropism (photo means light, tropism means movement).\n\nWe know that roots always grow downwards. This means that plant respond positively for gravitational force. This is called geotropism.\n\nIf we observe plant which grow near a rock or wall side. You notice that all roots are growing in one direction, away from the rock or wall where water is available in the soil. This type of response to water is called hydrotropism.\n\nA very interesting thing in plants is movement of tendrils. All plants show positive response to phototropism. But in creepers like cucumber, bitter gourd, the stem is weak and thin. Hence plant cannot grow erect. Tendrils play a vital role to make the plant erect. Tendrils are thin thread like growths on the leaves or stems of climbing plant. They grow towards support and wind around them. This type of response to make contact or touch is called thigmo tropism.\n\n![](images/2d47d547410ca84d8477db85aebd495afcb7b882fbca61df09d94198bcf2d1d5.jpg)  \nfig-22: Tendrils\n\nIf you taste the carpel of a flower it is sweet. Let us recall butterflies fluttering on flowers for this nectar. Ripen stigma secretes sugary substance. This chemical substance stimulates the pollen grain which falls on the stigma. Pollen grain responds to this stimulus as pollen tubes grow to reach the ovule for fertilization. This type\n\nof response to chemicals is called chemo tropism. Unequal distribution of auxins affects the root and the stem growth. High concentration of auxin stimulates stem growth and inhibit root growth.\n\n![](images/1c609bdc3d7f43a24364cf635417b49cbb131f0eadf824e418643f0613cc8465.jpg)",

In this process the sperms develop by mitotic division in male where as ova develop by meiotic division in female.\n\nParthenocarpy: Now a days we are able to develop seedless fruits like watermelon, grapes etc. Naturally in some plants like banana ovary directly develops into fruit without the process of fertilization this phenomenon is called as “Parthenocarpy” .

A good sample of mold may require 4-10 days to form spores so be sure to plan ahead for this project. (Please note: this should not be done by those with allergies to mold or with severe asthma.)\n\n![](images/8d778e6aaac6e7aebb380e741b29a22919a7585ce6abf48a092123194358a2cf.jpg)  \nfig-11\n\nLeave the bread in the open air for about an hour, so it is exposed to contaminants in the air. Place the bread in a plastic bag, sprinkle water over it to have dampness, then seal the bag, leaving some air inside. Place the bag in a dark, warm place. A kitchen cup board close to the stove may be one option. Or you could place it next to a window, with a bowl or lid covering it from the light. Mold will grow best in a moist environment. Mold would start growing in 2-3 days, but will take a week or more to form spores depending upon the weather conditions.\n\nCheck the piece of bread every few days, and add some water if it is drying. Avoid opening the plastic bag as much as you can. If you touch the bread, be sure to thoroughly wash your hands afterwards. When sufficient mold has formed, you can prepare a slide and examine it under the microscope. You would find whitish thread like growth with masses of black, grey and green fine dotted structures (See fig-11). The black dotted structure is that of bread mold. Take a part of the bread or roti to school in a matchbox and ask your teacher to help you to make a slide and observe under the microscope.\n\nAim: To prepare temporary slide of Rhizopus.\n\nMaterial required: Mold sample, plain glass slide, coverslip, water, disposable gloves.",

Fertilisation may occur either outside the body of the female organism (external fertilisation) or inside the female’s body (internal fertilisation). As a matter of fact, the eggs of land animals are fertilised inside the body of the female organism. The fertilized egg (the zygote) start dividing and grow into the embryo.\n\nExternal fertilisation is a common in aquatic animals like most of the fishes and amphibians. The female lays a vast number of eggs in water and male animal release some millions of sperms on them. As the chance of fertilisation is controlled by nature which occurs externally, hence it is inevitable to produce a vast number of eggs and sperms.",

Gradually, small pools of rapidly moving blood around these finger like projections in the uterine wall. These tissues of the chorion and the adjacent part of the uterine tissue make up the placenta.\n\nPlacenta is a tissue formed by the cells from the embryo and the mother. It is formed at around 12 weeks of pregnancy and becomes an important structure for nourishment of the embryo. Under normal conditions there is no direct flow of blood from mother to the young. The blood systems of the two are separated by thin membranes made up of cells that allow an exchange mainly by diffusion, of oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients, and waste materials.\n\nAmnion: Another embryonic membrane, the amnion, grows around the embryo itself. The cavity within the amnion becomes filled with fluid called amniotic fluid. The embryo develops in this fluid-filled cavity, which keeps it moist and protects it from minor mechanical injury. Yolksacs edged folding of amnion unite at allontois and forms a long tube like structure which connects the embryo with placanta.\n\nAllantois: Another membrane of the embryo called allantois.

    "text": "As pregnancy progresses, the foetus (of an embryo) with additional certain characters grow and the uterus increases in diameter. Usually at about the ninth month the head of the foetus is turned down towards the opening of the uterus. During birth, the head usually comes out first. Sometimes the feet come first; this makes the delivery more difficult. We still do not know much about the mechanism of child birth and how it is triggered.\n\nChildbirth begins when the muscle layers of the uterus starts to contract and relax rhythemically these actions are felt as labor pains. At first, muscular activity of the uterus is just strong enough to move the baby slowly toward the vagina, the outer canal of the female reproductive tract. Generally at this stage, the sac (amnion) around the baby breaks, and its fluid contents are released. This is a good sign that labour is well on its way. Then the contractions of the muscles become stronger and more frequent, and the baby is pushed out of the body through the vagina. Now the baby comes to this world.\n\nThe umbilical cord leading the baby to placenta, is tied off and cut by the doctor. (The small piece of cord remaining attached to the baby shrivels and falls off within a few days. The navel marks the place where it once\n\n![](images/38eabcc0c3bc8a9a6200ec0b04ad60f4798c676210cb95ebc9e03cc29ee7252d.jpg)\n\nentered the body.) After the birth of the baby, the muscular contractions of the uterus continue until they push out the tissues of the placenta, which are commonly called the “afterbirth.” During the end of pregnancy, a watery yellowish lymph like fluid called ‘colostrum’ accumulates in the mammary glands, which have gradually been enlarging and undergo transformation. For the first few days after the baby is born, the mammary glands secrete only colostrum. It is very important to feed this to the new born baby. It helps in developing the immune system of the child. After this milk will be screted. After child birth when production of milk stops menstural cycle will be started.\n\n![](images/552088794206323e099783dfa5168b582575b34d3ad349a8b60eeb3c751a3387.jpg)",

After double fertilization, the ovule increases in size rapidly as a result of the formation of endosperm tissue by mitosis and the development of the new embryo. The embryo consists of one or more cotyledons.R\n\nThe cotyledons develops by utilizing the food stored in endosperm. The cotyledons of some flowering plants, beans for example, digest, absorb, and store the foods from the endosperm as the ovule is maturing into a seed.

Many other flowering plants (such as corn or castor), the endosperm tissue continues to grow as the ovule matures into a seed.\n\nAfter fertilisation, the zygote divides several times to form an embryo within the ovule.

This was one of the first attempts to understand the mechanism of cell division. He stated that binary fission of cells was the means of reproduction of animal cells. What happens during cell division could only be understood better when scientists came to know what is present inside the nucleus of the cell.\n\nIn 1879 Walther Flemming (1843–1905) examined many kinds of animal and plant cells and selected those that showed division. He reported from his observations of such cells that there were\n\nstring like structures in the nucleus which split longitudinally during cell division. He named such a process of division as mitosis (mitos- means fine threads) as the dividing structures resembled threads. He made a meticulous observation and made sketches and observed that there were a sequence of events in the process of division. A decade later these thread like structures were named as chromosomes (coloured bodies) as repeatedly in efforts to see them scientists were trying to use dyes to stain the nucleus and found that these structures were stained most often. His most important discovery was chromosomes appear double in nature.\n\nWilhelm Roux (1850-1924) proposed that chromosomes carried a different set of heritable elements and longitudinal splitting observed by Flemming, ensured the equal division of these elements. Combined with the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel’s 1866 paper on heritable elements in peas, these results highlighted the central role of the chromosomes in carrying heritable material (or genetic material). In cell division the cell divides into two halves with equal number of chromosomes which are similar to parent cell and are diploid in nature.\n\nBut the chromosomes number always remained the same.

    "text": "We know that cell as the structural and functional units of life of any organism. In all organisms the cell divide and form new cells. The process of cell divisoin is same in unicellular organisms and highly evolved multicellular organisms like human being.\n\nCell division is the process that transforms a human fertilized egg into a baby in nine months and into an adult in the next 20 years. Cell division and function in a multicellular organism is highly regulated. It occurs only when there is a need for it.\n\nCells in some organs, such as heart and brain of an individual never divide. On the other hand bone marrow cells actively divide to produce red blood cells, which have a short life span 120 days in the body. For example, if you cut your finger and bleed, soon a blood clot forms to stop the bleeding. This brings in various chemicals to the site that stimulate skin cells to divide and heal the wound. Cell division ceases as the wound is completely healed. In contrast, cancer cells do not respond to such growth regulating factors and continuously divide at the expense of normal cells, thus ultimately killing the host. So it becomes important to understand the processes involved in cell division. The cell cycle will help us understand this better.\n\n![](images/82acf08e0d5d096292f118baeff089706232ef9265959dbc2e6fce1156b5408d.jpg)  \nfig-28: Interphase",

    "text": "The process of cell division is called ‘Mitosis’, which is completed in 40 to 60 minutes (this is the time of active division). The period between two cell divisions is called ‘Interphase’. This is actually the period when the genetic material makes its copy so that it is equally distributed to the daughter cells during mitosis. Interphase can be divided into three phases.\n\n1) G1 phase: This is the linking period between the completion of mitosis and\n\nthe beginning of DNA replication (Gap 1 phase). The cell size increase during this period.\n\n2) S phase: This is the period of DNA synthesis (Synthesis phase) leading duplication of chromosomes.   \n3) G2 phase: This is the time between the end of DNA replication and the beginning of mitosis.(Gap 2 phase). Cell organelles divide and prepare chromosome for mitosis.\n\nM phase: This is mitotic cell division phase. It includes prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase and cytokinesis.\n\nTo understand the functional relationship between these phases, Potu Narasimha Rao and Johnson (see annexure) conducted some experiments using the cell fusion technique. That is combining two cells in experimental conditions. With this cell fusion technique Johnson and Potu Rao revealed for the first time the structure of interphase(GI, S and G2) chromosomes that are not ordinarily visible under the microscope. They provided evidence on progression of cells through the cell cycle in sequential unidirectional and controlled way by a series of chemical signals that can diffuse freely between nucleus and cytoplasm. These experiments are considered to be a ‘mile stone’ in the cell cycle studies.",

Why?\n\nAs we have seen, the process of sexual maturation is gradual, and takes place while general body growth is still going on. Therefore, some degree of sexual maturation does not necessarily mean that the body or the mind is ready for sexual acts. Further, it is not fit for having and bringing up children. How do we decide if the body or the mind is ready for this major responsibility? All of us are under many different kinds of pressures about these issues. There can be pressure from our friends for participating in many activities, whether we really want or not. There can be pressure from families to get married and start having children. There can be pressure from government and voluntary organisations to avoid having children. In these situations, making right choices is important.\n\nIn the lesson $8 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ class “why do we fall ill”, we learnt that the diseases can be transmitted from person to person in a variety of ways. Since the sexual act is a very intimate connection of bodies, it is not surprising that many diseases can be sexually transmitted. These include bacterial infections such as Gonorrhoea and syphilis, and viral infections such as AIDS (Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome).\n\nWhat is the virus which causes AIDS?\n\nThese diseases spread by unsafe sexual contacts, using infected devices, infected blood transfusion, from an infected mother to child.\n\n![](images/7a9a0312e30f14dbcd5d69bb75af8ba966b7dc6de42028707b6b97143cee98b4.jpg)  \nfig-31: Red ribbon 1st December AIDS Day\n\nIt is very sad to say Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have the highest number of HIV positive patients in the country.

Any device or chemical (drug) which prevents pregnancy in woman is called a contraceptive. The birth control methods can be of various types and can be used by any of the partners as preferable. Physical devices such as condoms and diaphragm (cap) are used. This\n\nprevents reaching of sperms to ova for fertilisation. This device not only prevents fertilisation but also transmitting some sexually transmitted diseases (STD) like gonorrhoea, syphilis and AIDS. No other method of contraception provides protection against sexually transmitted diseases.

It has got some economic importance.\n\nIn grafting we can acquire desirable characters of plants.\n\nTissue culture is a modern technique of growing plants. It helps to grow more plants in less time and place.\n\nSexual reproduction in higher animals is through specialised organs, distinctively male and female reproductive systems.\n\nCells divide for growth of the individual to repair and replace the worn out cells and also for the formation of gametes.\n\nCell division is of two types-a) Mitosis-or somatic cell division B) meiosis-or reproductive cell division. The cell of the body may either be somatic cells that constitute the general body of the organism or germ cells that take part in formation of gametes.\n\nG-1, G-2, S and M are the stages in a cell cyclic which occur in a manner.\n\nThe longest phase is the synthesis phase in cell cycle where duplication of genetic material takes place. At the end of mitosis two daughter cells are formed with the number of chromosomes same as that of their parents. It runs through Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase and Telophase.\n\nDivision of cytoplasm is called Cytokinesis.\n\nDuring meiosis the parent cell divides twice and four daughter cells are formed.\n\nReproductive health is important to possess sound mind in a sound body.\n\nOne should be aware of the facts related to transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nThere is no cure for AIDS. Prevention is the only way to avoid it.\n\nNow a days various methods of contraception are available to control child birth.\n\nIt is our responsibility to build a healthy society.\n\nDetermination of sex before birth is illegal.\n\nStop female foeticide.",

He completed his graduation in Agriculture and did his MS at IARI, New Delhi. Later, he went to USA for research. He worked on the cytogenetics of tobacco plant. During his research, a cell line called Hela, isolated from a human tumour was established in 1952 and received his PhD in 1963. He switched his attention from plant cytogenetic to the field of cancer cells. He conducted research in cell kinematics and studied extensively on the ‘triggering factor’ of cell division i.e mitosis.\n\n![](images/55ea8b4300d1f90fbf6848c3180ab672451fd0ad8454bac70026fbdf539b76a3.jpg)  \nDr. Potu Narasimha Rao\n\n![](images/b8fa4125c32b4ff6f480f33089b2696a9aaed092e8511079a99cfec515d8ccbb.jpg)  \nHe La Cell\n\nHe found that human cells either normal or cancer cells in culture media usually divide every 20 to 24 hours. But actually normal mitosis is completed in 40 to 60 minutes. The period in between two cell divisions is called interphase. The interphase further consists of 3 phases G1, S and G2 phases.\n\nTo understand the functional relationship between these phases of cell cycle. Dr.N.Rao and his research associate Dr.Johnson conducted experiments on cell fusion technique. His researches revealed that the cell cycle is sequential\n\nUnidirectional and controlled by a series of chemical signals. His experiments are considered to be a milestone in the cell cycle studies.This study threw a new hope of rayC for the budding scientists to carry out researches on cell division.

Did you ever imagine the complexity of your body? Different life processes in living organisms like respiration, digestion, blood circulation, excretion, nervous system etc., are inbuilt in our body at their specific places and carry out their specific functions in a coordinated manner. We have studied each of the processes in detail nearly in isolation except in the chapter on ‘Control and Coordination’. In this chapter, we shall go a step further to experience the complexities involved and appreciate the wonderful integration in our life processes.\n\nLet’s recall the parts of the digestive canal or gut, that are involved in the digestive process where the food is broken down at different stages.\n\nWrite down the parts of the gut where the journey of food starts from mouth to anus.\n\nWhich type of life processes would be involved in the breakdown of food in the stomach?\n\nIf any of those processes fail to function, what affect would it have on our body?\n\nEvery process is dependent on other to keep the body in good condition. To understand this concept we analyze how digestive system is coordinated with other systems as an example. We shall study the digestive system from feeling hungry to utilization of food (converting in to energy), illustrating the inter connected processes going on in our body.",

Levels of different substances are generally maintained in the blood mainly by our digestive system. One of the major substances is glucose. When its levels in the blood fall, we get hunger pangs in stomach. This again involves production of a series of proteins, some of which are hormones like Ghrelin. Secretion of the hormone “Ghrelin” starts in the stomach when it goes empty. Ghrelin is secreted from certain cells in the wall of the stomach. Hunger contractions (hunger pangs) start to occur in the stomach due to hunger generating signals that reach the brain from the stomach due to the secretion of this hormone. It is believed that the Diencephalon in fore brain and vagus nerve (( $1 0 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ cranial nerve) plays an important role in carrying these signals to the brain. Hunger pangs continue up to 30- 45 minutes. Increase in ghrelin levels results in sensation of hunger and motivation to consume food.\n\nWhich nervous system controlls the hunger pangs.\n\nWhat kinds of controls are exercised during sensation of hunger? Are they hormonal or neural or both?\n\nCan you suggest any 4 systems involved in the process of generating hunger sensation?\n\nWhen you feel your stomach is full and there is no need of food any\n\nmore, another hormone leptin is secreted that suppresses hunger.",

Any food substance when placed on the tongue gets dissolved in the saliva secreted by salivary glands in the mouth.

As the food cannot be swallowed directly the teeth grind, chew and shred it. This process is called mastication. For this purpose the surface muscles of the jaw help in biting and chewing actions, and move the jaw up, down, forward and backward during food mastication. You may have observed your lower jaw moving up and down as you chew food. The teeth help in cutting and grinding while tongue movements evenly spread out the food and help in mixing it with saliva. The muscles of the mouth enable the food to be pushed in the oral cavity and to be moved around.

Besides this, the saliva in the bolus also aids in easy movement of food, which moves into the stomach.\n\nThe wall of the oesophagus is made up of two kinds of smooth muscles. The inner layer consists\n\nof circular muscles and the outer layer of longitudinal muscles. Contraction of the circular muscles results in narrowing of the oesophagus just behind the bolus. So the food is squeezed downwards. Contraction of the longitudinal muscles infront of the bolus widen the tube, this results in shortening of that particular part of the oesophagus. Contraction and relaxation of these muscles bring in a wave like motion that propels the food bolus into the stomach by the action called as “peristalsis” (you have studied about this in the chapter on nutrition). This is involuntary and under the control of autonomous nervous system.\n\nWhat makes the movement of the food bolus in the oesophagus easy?\n\nThink why people are advised not to swallow food without chewing properly or do not eat in hurry.",

The little brain in our inner yards, in connection with the big one in our skull, partly determines our mental state and plays key roles in certain diseases throughout the body.\n\nOften you may have experienced that if you have tension for some reason you start having loose motions. What does this show us?\n\nAlthough its influence is far-reaching, the second brain is not the seat of any conscious thoughts or decision-making. Technically known as the enteric nervous system, the second brain consists of sheaths of neurons embedded in the walls of the long tube of our gut, or alimentary canal, which measures about nine meters end to end from the oesophagus to the anus. The second brain contains some 100 million neurons, more than in either the spinal cord or the peripheral nervous system. This multitude of neurons in the enteric nervous system enables us to “feel” the inner world of our gut and its contents. Stimulating and coordinating the breaking down of food, absorbing nutrients, and expelling of waste requires chemical processing, mechanical mixing and rhythmic muscle contractions that move everything down the line.\n\nThus equipped with its own reflexes and senses, the second brain can control several gut functions often independently of the brain. Several scientists also believe that the system is a way too complicated to have evolved only to make sure things move through and out of our gut smoothly.\n\n![](images/5e077724e2f1dcca54e17d5f1a7192bcddc0fc56154b17aca7ec5da97673b039.jpg)\n\nWhat moves out of the gut?\n\nTwo major pathways of waste expulsion are shown above.

From here it enters the red blood cells and gets distributed throughout the cells of our body. At the same time carbon dioxide from the blood moves into the alveoli of the lungs and breathed out during exhalation. Nutrients in the cells get oxidized and energy is released.\n\nWhere is the energy stored?\n\nWhich system do you think will remove the excess salts from our body?\n\nWhat would be the path of salt removal from gut to the out side of our body?",

    "text": "During respiration we breathe continuously by inhaling and exhaling air. This is an involuntary process controlled by the medulla oblongata of the autonomous nervous system (ANS). During respiration the movement of inter costal muscles diaphragm moves the ribs cage inflating and deflating the lungs. Air containing more of oxygen enters the blood stream through lungs. If the oxygen has to reach the tissues it has to be circulated through blood. How does this process go on?\n\nHence the process of digestion which is a complex process that involves many organs and organ systems. Though digestion occurs in the food canal, co-ordination of respiration and blood circulation is necessary otherwise oxidation of food and transport of substances which is vital for energy releasing process will not take place. This may lead to the shut down of systems interdependent on each other.",

    "text": "The food taken by us has to be broken down into constituent substances for proper digestion, assimilation and energy releasing processes.\n\nThe human digestive system involves both the muscular and nervous systems.\n\nA special nervous system that exists in the gut consist of nearly 100 million nerves that coordinates the muscular activity ,blood flow,digestion and absorption of nutrients and other activities of the food canal (gastro intestinal tract).\n\nThe hormone Ghrelin secreted in the stomach is responsible for hunger generating sensations.\n\nAnother hormone leptin that gets secreted suppresses hunger.\n\nTaste can be identified easily only when the tongue is pressed against the palate.\n\nTaste and smell are closely related. The chemoreceptors present in the nose and the tongue trigger signals in the form of nerve impulses to the brain where the smell and taste is detected.\n\nThe saliva secreted maintains an alkaline medium that aids in digestion of starch. Our mouth secretes acid as well ,this gives protection to our mouth from harmful bacteria etc., Under the action of autonomous nervous system Saliva released by the salivary glands moistens the food to make chewing and swallowing easier.\n\nThe muscular and sensory organ in the oral cavity is the tongue which is not only gustatory in function but also performs different functions including, shifting and mixing the food in the oral cavity and swallowing.\n\nThe mechanism for swallowing is coordinated by the swallowing centre in the brain stem.\n\nContraction and relaxation of the muscles in the gut brings in a wave like motion that propels the food forward and is called peristalsis. This is a muscular wave that travels the entire length of the food canal. This is involuntary and under the control of autonomous nervous system as well as gut nervous system.\n\nThe muscular contractions of the stomach churns the food into a semiliquid substance known as chyme. Entry of chyme into the duodenum is regulated by a muscle called as the pyloric sphincter. The strong acid (HCl) renders the pH in stomach acidic causing the protein digesting enzymes to swing into function.\n\nJuices secreted in the stomach breaks down the food into a smooth mixture called chyme.\n\nThe mucus lining of the stomach protects it from damage by its own acids.\n\nThe coordination among the processes of digestion, respiration and circulation is necessary for utilization and oxidation of food and transport of the nutrients. Muscular and nervous control helps to carry out the processes in a regulated manner.",

The wound perforated the abdominal wall and stomach with profuse bleeding. Dr.Beaumont the army surgeon was called on to attend the wounded man. Dr. Beaumont cleaned the wound and pushed the protruding portions of lungs and stomach back into the cavity and dressed the wound.\n\nDr. Beaumont was surprised to see St. Martin alive the next day as he never expected so. With his medical expertise Dr. Beaumont treated the wound and did his best to extend his life. When the wound got healed completely, the stomach had fused with the body wall leaving a hole. Part of the wound formed a small flap that resembled a natural valve. This allowed Dr.Beaumont to draw out fluids from Martin’s stomach for testing.\n\nDr.Beaumont turned St.Martin to the left side depressing the flap he inserted a 5-6 inch tube into the stomach gathered gastric juice had its components identified. He introduced food through the hole of the stomach with a string attached to it so that he could retrieve the partially digested food for further examination. He conducted many experiments on food digestion to know the function of stomach which had not been done before. He discovered many things that were new to science.\n\nFor centuries stomach was thought to cook food by producing heat. Also theStomach was viewed as a mill,a fermenting vat or a stew pan. Through his experiments Dr.Beaumonts experiments revolutioned the concepts of digestion. June -on16,1822 became the beginning for the the most pioneering experiments in medicine. He recounted many of his observations and experiments in his journal which says “I consider myself but a humble experimentor “ in which the information provided still obeyed scientific method basing all the inferences on direct experimentation.\n\nSome of the discoveries of Dr.Beaumont were.",

When the food enters the stomach it excites the vessels to discharge its contents immediately for digestion.   \n4) He understood that digestion begins immediately when the food enters the stomach. He tested the contents of the stomach exactly 20mts after taking food (dinner containing ordinary food of boiled and salted beef, potatoes ,bread, beef and turnips) by collecting the fluids from the flap and found digestion had commenced and was progressing well at that time.   \n5) He also discovered that food in the stomach satisfies hunger even though its not eaten.

As we shall see, we would need to understand these two characteristics of life in order to understand how life evolves. When we say that something evolves, we mean not only that it changes, but that there is also some component of direction in that change.\n\nBut, how does evolution take place? Does it occur in a slow and steady manner or in quick jumps? Is it just about change and producing something new and different?\n\nIn the chapter on reproduction we had studied that reproductive processes usually give rise to individuals that have some new characters in spite of the similarity that they share with their parents. Often such new characters give rise to observable changes in life forms.\n\nHow are new characters produced?\n\nAre they inherited?\n\nDo they have any role in the process of evolution?\n\nIn this chapter we shall try to explore several such questions.",

(Hint: You know that seeds are formed from ovules)\n\nWhy variations are important? How are variations useful for an organism or a population?\n\nOver centuries variations and their role in nature have been studied by naturalists. During early $1 9 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century, a lot of work was done by several scientists. Some of these studies will help us to understand how variations occur and are transferred from one generation to the next. We shall study a detailed account of experimental evidences provided by Gregor Johann Mendel in the early $1 9 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century who is known as ‘Father of genetics’.\n\nIn 1857 Gregor Johann Mendel started working on the problem of how variations were passed from one generation to the other. Mendel did\n\nnot do his experimental work either in a University or in a Laboratory. As he was a monk in a monastery he simply did his experiments in the monastery garden. He worked for over seven years after which he presented the conclusions from his experimental data in the form of a detailed research paper.\n\nMendel made many careful observations of plants and found that pea plants would be most suitable to carry on further experimentation. Then he planned and designed the experiments to find out the answers to questions that came to his mind. He had worked on nearly 10,000 pea plants of 34 different varieties.\n\nObserving pea plants carefully, Mendel noted that they differ from one another in many ways. For example plants were tall or dwarf, seed shape round or wrinkled, seed coat (cotyledon) colour\n\nyellow or green. Thus, Mendel had chosen 7 pairs of contrasting characters for his study as shown in the table-3.\n\n![](images/46cd11816ac425fcc1bd2bcddfc9e76537342d3644d416ca505b797465751a5e.jpg)  \nfig-2: Gregor Johann Mendel\n\nTable - 3",

Let us see how sex is determined in human beings. Each human cell contains 23 pairs (46) of chromosomes. Out of 23 pairs 22 pairs of chromosomes are autosomes.\n\nChromosomes whose number and morphology do not differ between males and females of a species are called autosomes. The remaining pair is called allosomes or sex chromosomes. These are two types, one is ‘X’ and the other is ‘Y’. These two chromosomes determine the sex of an individual. Females have two ‘X’ chromosomes in their cells (XX). Males have one ‘X’ and one ‘Y’ chromosomes in their cells (XY). All the gametes (ova) produced by a woman have only X chromosomes. The gametes (sperm) produced by a man are of two types one with X chromosome and other Y chromosome. If the sperm carries Y chromosome and fertilizes the ovum (X chromosome). Then the baby will have XY condition. So the baby will be a boy.\n\nWhat will happen if the sperm containing X chromosomes fertilizes the ovum?\n\nWho decides the sex of the baby – mother or father?\n\nIs the sex also a character or trait? Does it follow Mendels’ law of dominance?\n\nWere all your traits similar to that of your parents?",

Imagine at this point an elephant comes by and stamps on the bushes where the beetles live. This kills most of the beetles. By chance the few beetles survived are mostly blue. Again the beetle population slowly increases. But in the beetle population most of them are in blue colour.

He thought that at some point of time in the history the size of giraffe was equal to that of deer. Due to shortage of food material on the ground and to reach the lower branches of trees giraffes started stretching their necks. Because of continuous stretching of neck, after several generations giraffes developed long necks. Such characters that are developed during the lifetime of an organism are called ‘acquired characters’. Lamarck proposed that these acquired\n\n![](images/004e378cd361704f2df72d521b9e41032534572db493722c1854786b7b2a2489.jpg)  \nfig-9: Jean Baptist Lamarck (1774-1829)\n\n![](images/2c57c59da1698b72c0fd97e1470d673a923bb31ddd990ac50b2d2e4cfd939166.jpg)\n\ncharacters are passed on to its offsprings i.e. to next generation and proposed the theory of ‘Inheritance of acquired characters’. For example elongation of neck and forelimbs in giraffe.\n\nBut August Weismann, tested this theory by an experiment on rats. He removed tails of parental rats. He observed that theirN offspring’s are normal with tails. He has done it again and again for twenty two generations but still offsprings are normal with tails. He proved that the bodily changes are not inherited. So they won’t be passed to it’s offsprings.\n\nDarwinismfig-10: Giraffee\n\nCharles Darwin proposed ‘Natural selection’ the famous ‘theory of evolution’.\n\n![](images/6179356ac2f58746f7d69de4c5f5a9a1fdd9bd8c42d9fa85772fc8d1838ec925.jpg)  \nfig-11: Charles Darwin (1809 – 1882)\n\nCharles Darwin (1809-1882) was born in England.

How do the beaks help them.\n\nHe was influenced by the book ‘Principles of geology’ written by Sir Charles Lyell. He suggested that geological changes occured\n\n![](images/09197ad3f418233cb2441cd360513a6a7ff1549e4ad22e4c66c558a989e69731.jpg)  \nfig-12: Some Darwin finches\n\nin a uniform rate, Darwin did not agree to this idea. He felt that large changes occured due to accumulation of small changes. Darwin was also influenced by the famous ‘Malthus theory’. This was written in ‘An essay on the principles of population’. Malthus observed that population grows in geometrical progression (1, 2, 4, 8, ......) where as food sources increases in arithmetic progression (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, .......).\n\nBased on these ideas, Darwin proposed the theory of “Natural selection”, which means that the nature only selects or decides which organism should survive or perish in nature. This is the meaning of survival of the fittest. The organisms with useful traits will survive. If traits are not usefull to organisms then they are going to be perished or eliminated from its environment.\n\nAlfred Russel Wallace also independently concluded that natural selection contributed to origin of new species. For example we have seen in the case of red beetles which were seen and eaten by crows. So, the population of red beetles gradually got eliminated or perished from its environment. But at the same time the beetles which are green in colour which are present on the green leaves were not noticed by crows. So the green beetles survived in the environment and their population have gradually increased. This is nothing but “natural selection”.",

The article was about Natural selection. Darwin was surprised about same theory in his mind. Later in the same year Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace jointly published an article in the ‘Journal of Linnaean Society’ about naturalT selection. It was only after this Darwin published his famous book, “The origin of Species” in 1859. However their thoughts\n\ngained criticism at that time because they did not explain how variations are inherited. After the discovery of mitosis and meiosis it was understood properly.",

This is known as speciation, which is also known as Macroevolution.\n\nWe have seen red and green beetles can mate each other and can have offsprings. But let us imagine that red and green beetles are separated by some cause (for example while eating beetles crows dropped some beetles accidently in the long distance far away places) for long years. There might be a lot of variations taken place in these years in the red and green beetle population. Now even though they may meet accidentally, they cannot mate and produce new offsprings. They can only mate in their population either red or green and can reproduce its off spring. Thus new species have been formed.",

You may be surprise to know that the internal structure of forelimb of a whale (swimmer) wing of a bat (flyer), leg of a cheetah (runner), claw of a mole (digger) and hand of a man (grasping). If we carefully observe the anatomy\n\nof all these animals, they show a common pattern in the arrangement of bones, even though their external form and functions are different. It indicates that all the vertebrates have evolved from a common ancestor and these organs are called homologous organs. This type of evolution is called divergent evolution.\n\nHowever, all similarities simply in organ shape are not necessarily to have a common ancestry. What would we think about the wings of birds and bats, for example (fig-). Birds and bats have wings, but squirrels and lizards do not. So birds and bats are more closely related to each other than squirrels or lizards.\n\n![](images/62897bb0ed2b92f142da27b31e47d2258edf895089d149a7ed018b11cb2ffa44.jpg)  \nfig-13: Homologous organs\n\n![](images/e7ac6487482e92e060d7dae321604842117ab7cf3564a7ee99fc0f4bf12a003e.jpg)  \nInsect wing\n\n![](images/94a90daf3d0d297825eeddc99b4ca0122c67c453e8302203d8a580c0276f541c.jpg)  \nBird wing   \nAnalogous organs\n\nBefore we jump into this conclusion, let us look at the wings of birds and bats more closely. When we observe, we find that the wings of bats have skin folds (patagium) stretched between elongated fingers. But the wings of birds have a feathery covering all along the arm. The designs of the two wings, their structure and components are different. They look similar because they have a common use for flying, but their origin is not common. This gives the ‘analogous’ characteristics (Traits). As the above mentioned organs which are structurally different but functionally similar are known as ‘Analogous organs’.

    "text": "Fossils are evidences of ancient life forms or ancient habitats which have been preserved by natural processes. Fossil evidence is typically preserved within the sediments deposited beneath water and land. They can be actual remains of once lived such as bones or seeds or even traces of past event such as dinosaur foot print or ripple marks on a pre-historic shore. Usually when organisms die, their bodies will be decomposed and lost. Sometimes the body or some parts of the body do not decompose\n\ncompletely. For example if a dead insect get caught in mud, it will not decompose quickly and the mud will eventually harden and retain the impression of the body parts of insect. All such preserved traces of extinct organisms are called fossils.\n\nGeologists can tell the age of a fossil. The study of fossil is called ‘Palaeontology’. Palaeontologists determine the age of fossil by using carbon dating method. The breakdown of radioactive isotopes of certain elements such as Carbon, Uranium and Potassium takes place at a known rate. So the age of rock or mineral containing isotopes can be calculated.\n\nCollect information about radio carbon dating method and radioactive isotopes and discuss with your teacher or from library display your collections in your class.\n\n![](images/dde493c6cd0064650109caecc6d673fa3dccc997a2a5f9c98c07a51dec98a79e.jpg)  \nfig-16: Dinosaur\n\nA rare and magnificient fossil of the dinosaurs, ketosaurs belonging to the lower Jurassic age going back to about 160 million years were collected from Yamanapalli in Adilabad district of Telangana.

This is called phenotype and the ratio is 3:1.\n\nIn F2 generation out of $7 5 \\%$ , $2 5 \\%$ were pure yellow seeds $50 \\%$ were yellow seeds but green as a recessive factor. Remaining $2 5 \\%$ were pure green. This is called genotype and the ratio 1:2:1.\n\nEvery pea plant has two ‘factors’ which are responsible for producing a particular property or trait called allele.\n\nThe factors for each pair of characters assorts independently of the other pairs. This is known as “Law of independent assortment”.\n\nCrossing yellow and green seeds produced all yellow seeds. Because yellow is dominant factor.\n\nEach parent passes randomly selected copy (allele) of only one of these to its offspring.\n\nThe process of acquiring characters or traits from parents is called ‘Heredity’.\n\nEach human cell contains 23 pairs of chromosomes. Out of these 22 pairs are called autosomes and one pair is called allosomes.\n\nLamarck proposed that the acquired characters are passed to the offspring in the next generation. Each species tend to produce large number of offsprings, but only the fittest can survive.\n\nHomologous, analogous organs and embryological evidences explain evolutionary relationships. Some traits in different organisms would be similar because they are inherited from a common ancestor.\n\nFossils are evidences of ancient life forms or ancient habitats which have been preserved by natural processes.",

These characters appeared independently without mixing with each other in F2 generation, which were produced by self pollination in F1 generation.\n\nObserve thc checker board given here carefully and note down different combinations of characters resulted from dihybrid cross.\n\n1.

The factors which are responsible for a character or trait of an organism, now named as ‘genes’. The pair of genes which are responsible for a character are called as ‘alleles’.

    "text": "Everyone is familiar with one’s own surrounding. It plays an important role in the survival of all organisms. The sum of physical and biological factors along with their chemical interactions that affect an organism is called environment. The living organisms always try to maintain a balance among them selves and with biotic and abiotic factors. All components of biosphere interact in an organized manner with the organisms. This interaction assures an organism to survive that may result in gradual evolution of the organisms in the biosphere. The physical factors refer to abiotic factors (land, air, water sun light etc) and biological factors to biotic factors (flora and fauna). The place where an organisms lives is called habitat. An organism can’t completely defy the balance to suit one’s need. It would in some way or the other affect the balance in such a way that the survival of the organism affecting the damage would be at stake.\n\nYou have understood the relationships between organisms and their food in earlier classes with the help of food chains and food webs.

In chapter 7 “Different Ecosystems” of class $8 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ it was mentioned that all organisms in an ecosystem derive energy from food to live and sunlight is the main source of the energy. Food chain shows that how the energy is passed from one organism to another. At each transfer a large proportion (80 toAt 90 percent) of energy is dissipated as heat produced during the process of respiration and other reactions. After three steps in a food chain, very little energy is still available for top carnivores to use.\n\nWithin the biosphere there are a number of major ecosystems. The terrestrial ecosystems are determined largely by the variations in climatic conditions between the Poles and Equator. In a similar way, if you climb a mountain such as Kilimanjaro in Equatorial Africa or Himalayan mountains in our country. You quickly go through a comparable system of ecosystems,\n\nstarting with tropical rain forest at the base and ending with perpetual snow and ice at the summit.\n\nThe main climatic influences which determine these ecosystems are rainfall, temperature and the availability of light from the sun. For instance, forests are usually associated with high rainfall, but the type of forest is influenced by temperature and light. The same applies to deserts which occur in regions where rainfall is extremely low.\n\nBut these links are never as simple or rigid as the word ‘chain’ suggests. For example, aphids are eaten by many insectivorous birds in addition to warblers, and also ladybirds and other insects; hawks, on the other hand, prey upon a considerable variety of birds and small mammal-So the term food web is often a better one to use when being precise, as it suggests a far greater number of possible links and reflects the fact that the whole\n\ncommunity is a complex inter-connected unit. Thus the original energy from the sun flows through the whole ecosystem from one tropic level to another.",

You will see from the diagram that animals fit into special positions within the food web; each is described as its niche. For instance, there is a niche for insects such as aphids which suck up the juices of leaves. Another niche for insects such as caterpillars which have strong jaws for biting off pieces of a leaf and a niche for relatively large animals such as deer which browse on the vegetation. All these animals feed on leaves but they differ both in size and in the manner in which they feed. So the term ‘niche’ denotes not only the animal’s position in the food web and what it eats, but also its mode of life. Just as a habitat is the place where an animal lives, so a niche describes its occupation the way it ‘goes about its business and earns its livings.\n\n![](images/1b2d62434a7dfc04cd560ee9ecb8da5c65a07c5228cba13d231b839e40d86dbd.jpg)  \nfig-2: Food chains in different ecosystems\n\nDiscuss one more example of niche with your teacher.",

The ecologists also used this idea of pyramid to show relationship among organisms in an existing food chain. In short we can say that graphic representation of the feeding level (tropic level) of an ecosystem in the shape of a\n\npyramid is called “Ecological pyramid”. It was first introduced by a British ecologist Charles Elton in 1927. In the ecological pyramid the producers (first trophic level) are represented at the base; and other successive trophic levels (primary, secondary and tertiary consumers) are represented one above the other with top carnivores at the tip. There are three types of pyramids; pyramid of biomass, pyramid of number, pyramid of energy. In this chapter we will try to discuss about the pyramid of number, biomass and energy.",

Is there any relationship\n\nbetween the numbers?Is there any comparison that could be made about the sizes of the organisms involved at each stage.\n\nThe number of organisms in a food chain can be represented graphically in a pyramid.

Any type of plant or animal material that can be converted into energy is called biomass. When these materials are used for energy production. They are known as biofuels.\n\nThe pyramid of biomass represents the relationships that exist between the quantity of living matter (biomass) at different trophic levels. In terrestrial ecosystems, the biomass progressively decreases from producers to top carnivores.\n\nAre the pyramids always upright?\n\nIn an aquatic ecosystem, the biomass of phytoplankton is quite negligible as compared to that of the crustaceans and small herbivorous fish that feed on these producers. The biomass of large carnivorous fish living on small fishes is still greater. This makes the pyramid of biomass inverted. It is found that $10 - 2 0 \\%$ of the biomass is transferred from one tropic level to the next in a food chain.\n\nA more accurate idea of food relationship may be obtained if the above pyramid of numbers is converted into a pyramid of biomass. This indicates the mass of plant matter which is used by the aphids to produce the mass of the of aphids population, the total mass of the ladybird population that could be supported by the aphids and so on through out the chain.

    "text": "To reduce our dependence on fossil fuels (fuels formed by natural processes such as anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms, like coal, petrol etc.), and to help reduce air pollution, biomass can also be used as a source energy. Using biomass as fuel still puts carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, but it is the same carbon dioxide taken from the air as the biomass was produced.\n\nThe biomass in a trophic level may be more or less than the other trophic levels. Biomass is a measure of the amount of food available. When animals eat, only a small proportion of their food is converted into new tissue, which inturn forms the food for the next trophic level. Most of the biomass that animals eat is either not digested, or used to provide the energy needed for staying alive.\n\nThe biomass pyramid shows that animals are relatively inefficient in converting food into body tissues, the remaining part of the food being undigested is passed out as waste, or broken down in respiration to supply\n\nenergy for activities such as feeding. Many animals convert not more than $10 \\%$ of their food into their body tissues, in some herbivores, it is even less. Let us take an example of a food chain which has been worked out in some detail- one in which we are involved when we eat fish. In this chain the plant plankton on the surface of waters of sea are food producers. They trap energy from sunlight. The animal plankton feed on the microscopic plants and the fish in turn feed on the animal plankton; we are at the end of the chain when we eat the fish.",

The food by its nature is the chemical energy and as in stored form, it is the potential energy. There are several mechanisms in organisms for continuous absorption of materials for the production of organic material, and for the release and conversion of organic material into inorganic form. Plants absorb the minerals from the soil. They are absorbed into the plant through roots.\n\n![](images/0000419f0caf1a4af97bf56920ce9e1aa38df2e9432a737e8488b58b444beb5b.jpg)  \nfig-7: Pyramid of Energy\n\nPhotosynthesis is an essential process for the life. The energy in sunlight, carbon dioxide and the water which are needed by all living things belong to nonliving things. As a result of photosynthesis, these can be made available in a suitable form of energy the food to the world of living things the animals or consumers, only by the green plants the producers. The food chains and food webs help in the transfer of the food and energy from the producers to different consumers. Animals obtain the minerals from the plant or animal food or both. Thus the mineral matter is constantly being removed from the earth to become a part of the plant, which may become a part of animal body.\n\nTry to identify the basic sources of various foods we eat. For example curd that we eat is processed from milk, which comes from a cow, which in turn eats grass. The grass carries out photosynthesis and prepares food. In every case, the origin of food materials can be traced back to green plants.\n\nOnce the food is eaten, its energy follows a variety of pattern through the organisms. Not all the food can be fully digested and assimilated. Hair, feathers, insect exoskeletons, cartilage and bone in animal foods, cellulose and lignin in plant foods cannot be digested by most animals. These\n\nmaterials are either ejected by defecation or regurgitated in pellets of indigested remains.",

Organisms lose some biomass by death, disease or annual leaf-drop, where they enter the detritus pathways of the food chain i.e., after the death and decomposition of organisms the materials flow back into the environment. The remaining biomass is eventually consumed by herbivores or predators and its energy there by enters the next higher trophic level in the ecosystem.\n\n![](images/d52b14d8ff5654d51b9ff18797e34775364b33270cc6e0df28529583d429d3a6.jpg)\n\nThe materials keep on cycling i.e. entering the living beings and through death and decay returning to the soil and atmosphere Such a flow of materials between organisms and their environment is called Cycling of materials or mineral circulation or Biogeochemical cycles (You have learnt in class IX ).\n\nEnergy enters the producers in the ecosystem from the sun in the form of solar energy or solar radiation. No other organisms except green plants and Photosynthetic bacteria due to the presence of chlorophyll are capable of absorbing solar energy and converting it into chemical energy (food).\n\nFrom the producers, the chemical energy passes to the consumers from one tropic level to the next through food. At each trophic level, organisms use most of the food energy that they assimilate into their bodies to fulfill their metabolic requirements- performance of work, growth and reproduction. Because biological energy transformations are inefficient, a substantial proportion of metabolized food energy is lost, unused as heat. Hence pyramid of energy is always upright.\n\nOnly a small fraction goes to the eater at next trophic level. Organisms are no different from man-made machines in this respect. Most of the energy in gasoline is lost as heat in a car’s engine rather than being transformed into the energy of motion. In natural communities, energy used to perform work or dissipated as heat cannot be consumed by other organism and is forever lost to the ecosystem.",

Excessive nutrient addition, especially from anthropogenic sources, led to explosive weed growth. Ex: Eichhornia, Pistia (Eutrophication).\n\nAs a result, the water of the lake turned more alkaline in nature, turbid, nutrient rich, low in Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and high in Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD). Which had great effect on aquatic animals. Water borne diseases like diarrhoea, typhoid, amoebiasis and others are said to be\n\ncommon among the local inhabitants who are unaware of the state of pollution in the lake water. Vector borne diseases also increased. Prawn and fish have been found to be affected by diseases leading to some farms being abandoned. The lands thus abandoned are useless for agriculture too.\n\nThe lake at present is prone to siltation, enchroachment, blockages in canals. Due to aquaculture, 15 local varieties of fishes are endangered.

In the entire history of sparrows around the world, they have never been hunted down as they were in China in 1958.\n\nA radical campaign to rapidly increase China’s industrial output by mobilizing the country’s vast rural peasantry took place at this time. It was set in motion\n\n![](images/5adadf52e5e116588cd808576a1dfdf59bffc835cd63572127f95b91f4e6d33b.jpg)  \nfig-9: Sparrow in danger\n\nby the government with the intention to achieve rapid increase in industrial production that China would catch up with the rest of the civilized world.

This over-reporting led to an imbalance between the demand and the supply. The sparrows were accused of pecking away at the supplies in warehouses at an officially estimated rate of four pounds of grain per sparrow per year. In the cities and the outskirts, almost half of the labour force was mobilized into the anti-sparrow army.\n\nPeople started trapping, poisoning and killing sparrows in large numbers. Several free-fire zones were set up for shooting the sparrows. People would beat drums to scare the birds from landing, so the sparrows were forced to keep flying until they dropped dead from fatigue. Sparrow nests were torn down, eggs were broken, and nestlings were killed. Non-material rewards and recognition were offered to schools, work units and government agencies in accordance with the number of sparrows killed.",

It is easy to say “Ban all pesticides” but the pests still have to be kept in check. After using pesticides then also we are having a significant amount of loss of food material because of pests. Now you can imagine if pesticides were totally banned what would happen to the diseases? Are they really controlling the pests that effect the crops we vitally need for our growing population?\n\nThe long term solution to this problem is to find other effective methods of controlling pests which have far less harmful effects and are based on sound biological principles.\n\nHere are some of the important methods to be used.\n\nRotation of crops: Growing different crops on a particular piece of land in successive years reduces the occurence of pests and damage to the crops from year to year in that area.\n\nStudying the life histories of the pests: By understanding how the pests spread and its stages in life history, the seeds can be sown at that time to reduce the damage to the crop.\n\nBiological control: Introducing natural predators or parasites of the pests.\n\nSterility :Rendering the males of a pest species sterile\n\nGenetic strains: The development of genetic strains (genetically modified plants) which are resistant to certain pest.\n\nEnvironmental ethics: This is concerned with morality of human activities as they affect the environment. People need to know besides laws regarding environment there are some basic ethics what is right and what is wrong in view of environment.\n\nSo one should have awareness about our environment.

Construction of soak pits to tap rainwater optimally was carried out as community efforts. Soakpits helped in recharging dried up bore wells. Dykes or barriers, nearly 30 cm thick of brick-cement or stone cement barrier, extending down to the compact bedrock, with mud or clay fillings were built in underground streams to tap ground water optimally.\n\nHow can wells be recharged?\n\nHow would recharging dried up wells help farmers of Vaddicherla?\n\nWhat does the case tell us about a water resource and its effect on farmers?",

It also releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Deforestation accounts for 15 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation also harms the people who rely on forests for their survival, hunting and gathering, harvesting forest products, or using the timber for firewood.\n\nSustainable forestry practices are critical for ensuring resources well into the future. Perhaps the bishnoi’s of Rajasthan could tell us how. As we recall brave Amrita Devi and her daughters, followed by villagers who clung to trees in the forest surrounding their village and laid down their lives to save them, we are faced with a realization about how great a movement towards conservation can be. They were protesting against the Kings’ order to collect wood for the construction of his palace and defending the pledge of peaceful coexistence taken by them as a bishnoi. It is a set of 29 rules to conserve natures’ resources that every bishnoi vows to protect.\n\nAs you have already studied about the Chenchu and Gondu tribes of our state and are aware of how carefully they extract resources from nature and help revive it. (refer lesson of VII class - Forest our life)\n\nSome sustainable forestry methods include using low-impact logging practices, harvesting with natural regeneration in mind, and avoiding certain logging techniques, such as removing all the high-value trees or all the largest trees from a forest.\n\nTrees can also be conserved if consumers recycle. People in China and Mexico, for example, reuse much of their wastepaper, including writing paper, wrapping paper, and cardboard. If half the world’s paper were recycled, much of the worldwide demand for new paper would be fulfilled, saving many of the Earth’s trees. We can also replace some wood products with alternatives like bamboo, which is actually a type of grass, that grows very fast.",

Many other types of conservation efforts, such as plant conservation and animal conservation, depend on soil conservation.\n\nPoor farming methods, such as repeatedly planting the same type of crop in the same place, deplete nutrients in the soil. Soil erosion by water and wind increases when farmers plough up and down hills.\n\nOne soil conservation method is called contour strip cropping. Several crops, such as corn, wheat, and clover, are planted in alternating strips across a slope or across the path of the prevailing wind. Different crops, with different root systems and leaves, help to prevent soil erosion. Selective harvesting methods means we harvest mature commertial trees of a specific diameter on a rotational cycle to maintain the forest Ecobalance. Harvested areas are then closed for a prescribed period of time before the next harvest cycle in the same area. This provides younger trees a chance to grow full commertial potential while removing aged tress that would otherwise die naturally allowing forest to regenerate naturally.",

We need a rich mixture of living things to provide foods, building materials, and medicines, as well as to maintain a clean and healthy landscape.\n\nWhen a species becomes extinct, it is lost to the world forever. Scientists estimate that the current rate of extinction is 1,000 times the natural rate. Through hunting, pollution, habitat destruction, people are speeding up the loss of biodiversity at an alarming rate. It’s hard to know how many species are going extinct because the total number of species is unknown. Scientists discover thousands of new species every year. For example, after looking at just 19 trees in Panama, scientists found 1,200 different species of beetles 80 percent of them unknown to science at the time. Based on various estimates of the number of species on Earth, we could be losing anywhere from 200 to 100,000 species each year.\n\nWe need to protect biodiversity to ensure plentiful and varied food sources.\n\nBiodiversity is more important than food. For instance, we use between 50,000 to 70,000 plant species for medicines worldwide.\n\nA lawn in a colony is usually a pleasant sight but do you know that a lot of species of plants are completely destroyed to grow the type of grass on the lawn?

But the latest figure shows that today three-quarters of the human population live in countries which consume more than they can replenish. The issue of replenishment is large yet we have our individual roles.\n\nSmall steps could become great efforts at conservation. What does the Kothapally experience tell us about step towards management and conservation?\n\nYou may have already come across the four R’s to save the environment.\n\nThey are Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Recover.\n\n1. Reduce: We can save water by repairing leaky taps and avoiding a shower or switching off unnecessary lights and fans.\n\nThink of other things that you could reduce usage of.\n\nDo you think it is necessary to have a lot of lighting for decoration during celebrations?\n\n2. Reuse: things that you often tend to throw away, like paper and wrapping papers. This would save plants and minimise pollution.\n\nWhat other things could you reuse to save our resources?\n\n3. Recycle: It is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects (eg) some metals, glass, paper etc. Recycling may not always be a very good option as recycling plastic is a tricky process and can cause havoc. The chief problem lies in plastics’ complexity. There are as many types of plastic as their uses. Since each type can only be recycled with its own kind, plastics need to be carefully sorted before they can be processed.\n\nWhy should one sort wastes carefully before discarding them from home?\n\nOften we keep a plastic bag in our dustbins to discard waste, is it a good practise?\n\n![](images/86245a4bb5dd9e1086f77232d183c511aa1536aab3b452e05a71a7dd2c60455d.jpg)  \nfig-9: Bag from waste material",
