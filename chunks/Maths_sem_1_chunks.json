    "text": "### 1.1 Introduction\n\nIn Class IX, you began your exploration of the world of real numbers and encountered irrational numbers. We continue our discussion on real numbers in this chapter. We begin with two very important properties of positive integers in Sections 1.2 and 1.3, namely the Euclid’s division algorithm and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\n\nEuclid’s division algorithm, as the name suggests, has to do with divisibility of integers. Stated simply, it says any positive integer a can be divided by another positive integer $b$ in such a way that it leaves a remainder r that is smaller than $b$ . Many of you probably recognise this as the usual long division process. Although this result is quite easy to state and understand, it has many applications related to the divisibility properties of integers. We touch upon a few of them, and use it mainly to compute the HCF of two positive integers.\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, on the other hand, has to do something with multiplication of positive integers. You already know that every composite number can be expressed as a product of primes in a unique way — this important fact is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Again, while it is a result that is easy to state and understand, it has some very deep and significant applications in the field of mathematics. We use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic for two main applications. First, we use it to prove the irrationality of many of the numbers you studied in Class IX, such as ${ \\sqrt { 2 } } , { \\sqrt { 3 } }$ and $\\sqrt { 5 }$ . Second, we apply this theorem to explore when exactly the decimal expansion of a rational number, say ${ \\frac { p } { q } } ( q \\neq 0 )$ , is terminating and when it is non-terminating repeating. We do so by looking at the prime factorisation of the denominator $q$ of $\\frac { p } { q }$ . You will see that the prime factorisation of $q$ will completely reveal the nature of the decimal expansion of $\\frac { p } { a }$ . q\n\nSo let us begin our exploration.",

    "text": "In your earlier classes, you have seen that any natural number can be written as a product of its prime factors. For instance, $2 = 2$ , $4 = 2 \\times 2$ , $2 5 3 = 1 1 \\times 2 3$ , and so on. Now, let us try and look at natural numbers from the other direction. That is, can any natural number be obtained by multiplying prime numbers? Let us see.\n\nTake any collection of prime numbers, say 2, 3, 7, 11 and 23. If we multiply some or all of these numbers, allowing them to repeat as many times as we wish, we can produce a large collection of positive integers (In fact, infinitely many). Let us list a few :\n\n$$\n7 \\times 1 1 \\times 2 3 = 1 7 7 1 \\quad 3 \\times 7 \\times 1 1 \\times 2 3 = 5 3 1 3\n$$\n\n$$\n2 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 1 1 \\times 2 3 = 1 0 6 2 6 2 ^ {3} \\times 3 \\times 7 ^ {3} = 8 2 3 2\n$$\n\n$$\n2 ^ {2} \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 1 1 \\times 2 3 = 2 1 2 5 2\n$$\n\nand so on.\n\nNow, let us suppose your collection of primes includes all the possible primes. What is your guess about the size of this collection? Does it contain only a finite number of integers,\n\nor infinitely many? Infact, there are infinitely many primes. So, if we combine all these primes in all possible ways, we will get an infinite collection of numbers, all the primes and all possible products of primes. The question is – can we produce all the composite numbers this way? What do you think? Do you think that there may be a composite number which is not the product of powers of primes? Before we answer this, let us factorise positive integers, that is, do the opposite of what we have done so far.\n\nWe are going to use the factor tree with which you are all familiar. Let us take some large number, say, 32760, and factorise it as shown.",

(Try it out for several other natural numbers yourself.) This leads us to a conjecture that every composite number can be written as the product of powers of primes. In fact, this statement is true, and is called the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic because of its basic crucial importance to the study of integers. Let us now formally state this theorem.\n\nTheorem 1.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) : Every composite number can be expressed (factorised) as a product of primes, and this factorisation is unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur.\n\nAn equivalent version of Theorem 1.2 was probably first recorded as Proposition 14 of Book IX in Euclid’s Elements, before it came to be known as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. However, the first correct proof was given by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae.\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss is often referred to as the ‘Prince of Mathematicians’ and is considered one of the three greatest mathematicians of all time, along with Archimedes and Newton. He has made fundamental contributions to both mathematics and science.\n\n![](images/6b969ad52c0da15c624b65d10e4992b90e214f001e2a10419f9253253aa03516.jpg)  \nCarl Friedrich Gauss (1777 – 1855)",

    "text": "The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says that every composite number can be factorised as a product of primes. Actually it says more. It says that given any composite number it can be factorised as a product of prime numbers in a ‘unique’ way, except for the order in which the primes occur. That is, given any composite number there is one and only one way to write it as a product of primes, as long as we are not particular about the order in which the primes occur. So, for example, we regard $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7$ as the same as $3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 2$ , or any other possible order in which these primes are written. This fact is also stated in the following form:\n\nThe prime factorisation of a natural number is unique, except for the order of its factors.\n\nIn general, given a composite number $x$ , we factorise it as $x = p _ { 1 } p _ { 2 } \\ldots p _ { n } ,$ where $p _ { 1 } , p _ { 2 } , . . . , p _ { n }$ are primes and written in ascending order, i.e., $p _ { 1 } { \\leq } p _ { 2 } { \\leq } . . . { \\leq } p _ { n } .$ .

So, the uniqueness of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic guarantees that there are no other primes in the factorisation of $4 ^ { n }$ .

For example, $4 x + 2$ is a polynomial in the variable $x$ of degree 1, $2 y ^ { 2 } - 3 y + 4$ is a polynomial in the variable y of degree 2, $5 x ^ { 3 } - 4 x ^ { 2 } + x - \\sqrt { 2 }$ is a polynomial in the variable $x$ of degree 3 and $7 u ^ { 6 } - \\frac { 3 } { 2 } u ^ { 4 } + 4 u ^ { 2 } + u - 8$ 二 is a polynomial in the variable $u$ of degree 6. Expressions like $\\frac { 1 } { x - 1 }$ ${ \\frac { 1 } { x - 1 } } , { \\sqrt { x } } + 2 , { \\frac { 1 } { x ^ { 2 } + 2 x + 3 } }$ etc., are not polynomials. x - 1\n\nA polynomial of degree 1 is called a linear polynomial.

For example, the graph of $y = 2 x + 3$ is a straight line passing through the points $( - 2 , - 1 )$ and (2, 7).\n\n<table><tr><td>x</td><td>-2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>y=2x+3</td><td>-1</td><td>7</td></tr></table>\n\nFrom Fig. 2.1, you can see that the graph of $y = 2 x + 3$ intersects the $x$ -axis mid-way between $x = - 1$ and $x = - 2$ , that is, at the point 3 , 0æ ö-ç ÷ . $\\left( - { \\frac { 3 } { 2 } } , 0 \\right)$ You also know that the zero of $2 x + 3$ is $- { \\frac { 3 } { 2 } }$ . Thus, the zero of the polynomial $2 x \\quad + \\quad 3$ i s th e $x$ -coordinate of the point where the graph of $y = 2 x + 3$ intersects the $x \\cdot$ - axis.\n\n![](images/8402bf78345c4aee0adc2146fae66153a29911b844860f05ee746fd9d87af557.jpg)  \nFig. 2.1",

Therefore, the linear polynomial $a x + b$ , $a \\neq 0$ , has exactly one zero, namely, the $x \\cdot$ -coordinate of the point where the graph of $y = a x + b$ intersects the $x$ -axis.\n\nNow, let us look for the geometrical meaning of a zero of a quadratic polynomial. Consider the quadratic polynomial $x ^ { 2 } - 3 x - 4 .$ Let us see what the graph* of $y = x ^ { 2 } - 3 x - 4$ looks like.

We will now try to answer the question raised in Section 2.1 regarding the relationship between zeroes and coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial, $\\operatorname { s a y } p ( x ) = 2 x ^ { 2 } - 8 x + 6$ . In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term $\\smile 8 x \\ '$ as a sum of two terms, whose product is $6 \\times 2 x ^ { 2 } = 1 2 x ^ { 2 }$ . So, we write\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l} 2 x ^ {2} - 8 x + 6 = 2 x ^ {2} - 6 x - 2 x + 6 = 2 x (x - 3) - 2 (x - 3) \\\\ = (2 x - 2) (x - 3) = 2 (x - 1) (x - 3) \\\\ \\end{array}\n$$\n\nSo, the value of $p ( x ) = 2 x ^ { 2 } - 8 x + 6$ is zero when $x - 1 = 0$ or $x - 3 = 0$ , i.e., when $x = 1$ or $x = 3$ . So, the zeroes of $2 x ^ { 2 } - 8 x + 6$ are 1 and 3.

    "text": "### 3.1 Introduction\n\nYou must have come across situations like the one given below :\n\nAkhila went to a fair in her village. She wanted to enjoy rides on the Giant Wheel and play Hoopla (a game in which you throw a ring on the items kept in a stall, and if the ring covers any object completely, you get it). The number of times she played Hoopla is half the number of rides she had on the Giant Wheel. If each ride costs $\\yen 3$ , and a game of Hoopla costs $\\yen 4$ , how would you find out the number of rides she had and how many times she played Hoopla, provided she spent $\\yen 20$ .\n\nMay be you will try it by considering different cases. If she has one ride, is it possible? Is it possible to have two rides? And so on. Or you may use the knowledge of Class IX, to represent such situations as linear equations in two variables.\n\n![](images/a14859a86cc1bf84d14eabb899a118bdb7e8c1237e87e972d4083b14d9e8e9f7.jpg)\n\nLet us try this approach.\n\nDenote the number of rides that Akhila had by $x _ { \\mathrm { { ; } } }$ , and the number of times she played Hoopla by y. Now the situation can be represented by the two equations:\n\n$$\ny = \\frac {1}{2} x \\tag {1}\n$$\n\n$$\n3 x + 4 y = 2 0 \\tag {2}\n$$\n\nCan we find the solutions of this pair of equations? There are several ways of finding these, which we will study in this chapter.",

    "text": "A pair of linear equations which has no solution, is called an inconsistent pair of linear equations. A pair of linear equations in two variables, which has a solution, is called a consistent pair of linear equations. A pair of linear equations which are equivalent has infinitely many distinct common solutions. Such a pair is called a dependent pair of linear equations in two variables. Note that a dependent pair of linear equations is always consistent.\n\nWe can now summarise the behaviour of lines representing a pair of linear equations in two variables and the existence of solutions as follows:\n\n(i) the lines may intersect in a single point. In this case, the pair of equations has a unique solution (consistent pair of equations).   \n(ii) the lines may be parallel. In this case, the equations have no solution (inconsistent pair of equations).   \n(iii) the lines may be coincident. In this case, the equations have infinitely many solutions [dependent (consistent) pair of equations].\n\nConsider the following three pairs of equations.\n\n(i) $x - 2 y = 0$ and $3 x + 4 y - 2 0 = 0$ (The lines intersect)   \n(ii) $2 x + 3 y - 9 = 0$ and $4 x + 6 y - 1 8 = 0$ (The lines coincide)   \n(iii) $x + 2 y - 4 = 0$ and $2 x + 4 y - 1 2 = 0$ (The lines are parallel)\n\nLet us now write down, and compare, the values of 1 , a $\\frac { a _ { 1 } } { a _ { 2 } } , \\frac { b _ { 1 } } { b _ { 2 } }$ and $\\frac { c _ { 1 } } { c _ { 2 } }$ in all the three examples.

    "text": "Remark : We have substituted the value of one variable by expressing it in terms of the other variable to solve the pair of linear equations. That is why the method is known as the substitution method.\n\nExample 5 : Solve the following question—Aftab tells his daughter, “Seven years ago, I was seven times as old as you were then. Also, three years from now, I shall be three times as old as you will be.” (Isn’t this interesting?) Represent this situation algebraically and graphically by the method of substitution.\n\nSolution : Let $s$ and $t$ be the ages (in years) of Aftab and his daughter, respectively. Then, the pair of linear equations that represent the situation is\n\n$$\ns - 7 = 7 (t - 7), \\text {i . e .}, \\quad s - 7 t + 4 2 = 0 \\tag {1}\n$$\n\nand $s + 3 = 3 ( t + 3 )$ , i.e., $s - 3 t = 6$ (2)\n\nUsing Equation (2), we get $s = 3 t + 6$ .\n\nPutting this value of $s$ in Equation (1), we get\n\n$$\n(3 t + 6) - 7 t + 4 2 = 0,\n$$\n\ni.e., $4 t = 4 8$ , which gives $t = 1 2$ .\n\nPutting this value of $t$ in Equation (2), we get\n\n$$\ns = 3 (1 2) + 6 = 4 2\n$$\n\nSo, Aftab and his daughter are 42 and 12 years old, respectively.\n\nVerify this answer by checking if it satisfies the conditions of the given problems.\n\nExample 6 : In a shop the cost of 2 pencils and 3 erasers is `9 and the cost of 4 pencils and 6 erasers is `18.

When we equate this polynomial to zero, we get a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations come up when we deal with many real-life situations.\n\nFor instance, suppose a charity trust decides to build a prayer hall having a carpet area of 300 square metres with its length one metre more than twice its breadth. What should be the length and breadth of the hall? Suppose the breadth of the hall is $x$ metres. Then, its length should be $( 2 x + 1 )$ metres. We can depict this information pictorially as shown in Fig. 4.1.\n\n![](images/724a8b3c7e530d7ffd56620333f12c1970e33ea69257d9d54e234432d4230b15.jpg)  \nFig. 4.1\n\nNow, area of the hall $= ( 2 x + 1 )$ . $x \\ : \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } = ( 2 x ^ { 2 } + x ) \\ : \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$\n\nSo, $2 x ^ { 2 } + x = 3 0 0$ (Given)\n\nTherefore, $2 x ^ { 2 } + x - 3 0 0 = 0$\n\nSo, the breadth of the hall should satisfy the equation $2 x ^ { 2 } + x - 3 0 0 = 0$ which is a quadratic equation.",

    "text": "Many people believe that Babylonians were the first to solve quadratic equations. For instance, they knew how to find two positive numbers with a given positive sum and a given positive product, and this problem is equivalent to solving a quadratic equation of the form $x ^ { 2 } - p x + q = 0$ . Greek mathematician Euclid developed a geometrical approach for finding out lengths which, in our present day terminology, are solutions of quadratic equations. Solving of quadratic equations, in general form, is often credited to ancient Indian mathematicians. In fact, Brahmagupta (C.E.598–665) gave an explicit formula to solve a quadratic equation of the form $a x ^ { 2 } + b x = c$ . Later,\n\nSridharacharya (C.E. 1025) derived a formula, now known as the quadratic formula, (as quoted by Bhaskara II) for solving a quadratic equation by the method of completing the square. An Arab mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (about C.E. 800) also studied quadratic equations of different types. Abraham bar Hiyya Ha-Nasi, i n his book ‘Liber embadorum’ published in Europe in C.E. 1145 gave complete solutions of different quadratic equations.\n\nIn this chapter, you will study quadratic equations, and various ways of finding their roots. You will also see some applications of quadratic equations in daily life situations.",

    "text": "A quadratic equation in the variable $x$ is an equation of the form $a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c = 0$ , where $a , b .$ , c are real numbers, $a \\neq 0$ . For example, $2 x ^ { 2 } + x - 3 0 0 = 0$ is a quadratic equation. Similarly, $2 x ^ { 2 } - 3 x ^ { + }$ $1 = 0$ $1 = 0 , 4 x - 3 x ^ { 2 } + 2 = 0$ and $1 - x ^ { 2 } + 3 0 0 = 0$ are also quadratic equations.\n\nIn fact, any equation of the form $p ( x ) = 0$ , where $p ( x )$ is a polynomial of degree 2, is a quadratic equation. But when we write the terms of $p ( x )$ in descending order of their degrees, then we get the standard form of the equation. That is, $a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c = 0$ , $a \\neq 0$ is called the standard form of a quadratic equation.\n\nQuadratic equations arise in several situations in the world around us and in different fields of mathematics.

Let us see how.\n\nExample 3 : Find the roots of the equation $2 x ^ { 2 } - 5 x + 3 = 0$ , by factorisation.\n\nSolution : Let us first split the middle term – $5 x$ as $- 2 x - 3 x$ [because $( - 2 x ) \\times ( - 3 x ) = 6 x ^ { 2 } =$ $( 2 x ^ { 2 } ) \\times 3 ]$ .",

Some such examples are :\n\n(i) Reena applied for a job and got selected. She has been offered a job with a starting monthly salary of ` 8000, with an annual increment of ` 500 in her salary.

The bottom rung is 45 cm in length. The lengths (in cm) of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . ., 8th rung from the bottom to the top are, respectively\n\n45, 43, 41, 39, 37, 35, 33, 31\n\n![](images/e5c614d1a2029ab29b77aa2965fc82da8ddb3f78728a19f2333895727d8c02a7.jpg)  \nFig. 5.1\n\n(iii) In a savings scheme, the amount becomes $\\frac { 5 } { 4 }$ times of itself after every 3 years. The maturity amount (in `) of an investment of ` 8000 after 3, 6, 9 and 12 years will be, respectively : 10000, 12500, 15625, 19531.25\n\n(iv) The number of unit squares in squares with side 1, 2, 3, . . . units (see Fig. 5.2) are, respectively 12, 22, 32, . . .\n\n![](images/8381767e85108296681d46484bc31b0246f8f756db8d6c23047b15e89a76eb1f.jpg)  \nFig. 5.2",

If so, how will you write it? Perhaps by following a pattern or rule. Let us observe and write the rule.\n\nIn (i), each term is 1 more than the term preceding it.\n\nIn (ii), each term is 30 less than the term preceding it.\n\nIn (iii), each term is obtained by adding 1 to the term preceding it.\n\nIn (iv), all the terms in the list are 3 , i.e., each term is obtained by adding (or subtracting) 0 to the term preceding it.   \nIn (v), each term is obtained by adding – 0.5 to (i.e., subtracting 0.5 from) the term preceding it.\n\nIn all the lists above, we see that successive terms are obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding terms. Such list of numbers is said to form an Arithmetic Progression ( AP ).\n\nSo, an arithmetic progression is a list of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding term except the first term.\n\nThis fixed number is called the common difference of the AP.

Recall that two figures are said to be congruent, if they have the same shape and the same size. In this chapter, we shall study about those figures which have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. Two figures having the same shape (and not necessarily the same size) are called similar figures. In particular, we shall discuss the similarity of triangles and apply this knowledge in giving a simple proof of Pythagoras Theorem learnt earlier.\n\nCan you guess how heights of mountains (say Mount Everest) or distances of some long distant objects (say moon) have been found out? Do you think these have\n\n![](images/26f7f4d331eafd9615226bef181f4b590155981c8ba56f3b278bd1815fba14f6.jpg)\n\n![](images/aca462967b51ac009502f2e3f6d93a1007c3fe20dcc7b8948d9aa0677bff90f9.jpg)\n\nbeen measured directly with the help of a measuring tape? In fact, all these heights and distances have been found out using the idea of indirect measurements, which is based on the principle of similarity of figures (see Example 7, Q.15 of Exercise 6.3 and also Chapters 8 and 9 of this book)",

Are they congruent? Since all of them do not have the same radius, they are not congruent to each other. Note that some are congruent and some are not, but all of them have the same shape. So they all are, what we call, similar. Two similar figures have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. Therefore, all circles are similar. What about two (or more) squares or two (or more) equilateral triangles [see Fig. 6.1 (ii) and (iii)]? As observed in the case of circles, here also all squares are similar and all equilateral triangles are similar.\n\nFrom the above, we can say that all congruent figures are similar but the similar figures need not be congruent.\n\nCan a circle and a square be similar?

    "text": "You will at once say that they are the photographs of the same monument (Taj Mahal) but are in different sizes. Would you say that the three photographs are similar? Yes,they are.\n\nWhat can you say about the two photographs of the same size of the same person one at the age of 10 years and the other at the age of 40 years? Are these photographs similar? These photographs are of the same size but certainly they are not of the same shape. So, they are not similar.\n\nWhat does the photographer do when she prints photographs of different sizes from the same negative? You must have heard about the stamp size, passport size and postcard size photographs. She generally takes a photograph on a small size film, say of 35mm size and then enlarges it into a bigger size, say 45mm (or $5 5 \\mathrm { m m } )$ ). Thus, if we consider any line segment in the smaller photograph (figure), its corresponding line segment in the bigger photograph (figure) will be ${ \\frac { 4 5 } { 3 5 } } \\left( \\operatorname { o r } { \\frac { 5 5 } { 3 5 } } \\right)$ of that of the line segment. This really means that every line segment of the smaller photograph is enlarged (increased) in the ratio 35:45 (or 35:55). It can also be said that every line segment of the bigger photograph is reduced (decreased) in the ratio 45:35 (or 55:35). Further, if you consider inclinations (or angles) between any pair of corresponding line segments in the two photographs of different sizes, you shall see that these inclinations(or angles) are always equal. This is the essence of the similarity of two figures and in particular of two polygons. We say that:\n\nTwo polygons of the same number of sides are similar, $i f ( i )$ their corresponding angles are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion).\n\nNote that the same ratio of the corresponding sides is referred to as the scale factor (or the Representative Fraction) for the polygons. You must have heard that world maps (i.e., global maps) and blue prints for the construction of a building are prepared using a suitable scale factor and observing certain conventions.\n\nIn order to understand similarity of figures more clearly, let us perform the following activity:",

Let us cut a polygon, say a quadrilateral ABCD, from a plane cardboard and place this cardboard parallel to the ground between the lighted bulb and the table. Then a shadow of ABCD is cast on the table. Mark the outline of this shadow as $\\mathrm { { A ^ { \\prime } B ^ { \\prime } C ^ { \\prime } D ^ { \\prime } } }$ (see Fig.6.4).\n\nNote that the quadrilateral $\\mathrm { { A ^ { \\prime } B ^ { \\prime } C ^ { \\prime } D ^ { \\prime } } }$ is an enlargement (or magnification) of the quadrilateral ABCD.

A famous Greek mathematician Thales gave an important truth relating to two equiangular triangles which is as follows:\n\nThe ratio of any two corresponding sides in two equiangular triangles is always the same.\n\nIt is believed that he had used a result called the Basic Proportionality Theorem (now known as the Thales Theorem) for the same.\n\nTo understand the Basic Proportionality Theorem, let us perform the following activity:\n\nActivity $2 :$ Draw any angle XAY and on its one arm AX, mark points (say five points) P, Q, D, R and B such that $\\mathrm { A P = P Q = Q D = D R = R B }$ .\n\nNow, through B, draw any line intersecting arm AY at C (see Fig. 6.9).\n\nAlso, through the point D, draw a line parallel to BC to intersect AC at E.

However, we can write $\\Delta \\mathrm { B A C } \\sim \\Delta$ EDF.\n\nNow a natural question arises : For checking the similarity of two triangles, say ABC and DEF, should we always look for all the equality relations of their corresponding angles ( $\\angle \\mathbf { A } =$ Ð D, $\\angle \\mathrm { B } = \\angle \\mathrm { E }$ , $\\angle \\mathrm { C } = \\angle \\mathrm { F }$ ) and all the equality relations of the ratios of their corresponding sides $\\left( { \\frac { \\mathrm { A B } } { \\mathrm { D E } } } = { \\frac { \\mathrm { B C } } { \\mathrm { E F } } } = { \\frac { \\mathrm { C A } } { \\mathrm { F D } } } \\right) \\colon$ Let us examine.

In the two triangles ABC and DEF, you can see that $\\angle \\mathrm { B } = \\angle \\mathrm { E }$ , $\\angle \\mathrm { C } = \\angle \\mathrm { F }$ and $\\angle \\mathrm { A } { } = \\angle \\mathrm { D } { }$ . That is, corresponding angles of these two triangles are equal. What can you say about their corresponding sides ? Note that $\\frac { \\mathrm { B C } } { \\mathrm { E F } } = \\frac { 3 } { 5 } = 0 . 6$ . What about $\\frac { \\mathrm { A B } } { \\mathrm { D E } }$ an d CAFD ? On measuring AB, DE, CA and FD, you will find that $\\frac { \\mathrm { C A } } { \\mathrm { F D } }$ $\\frac { \\mathrm { A B } } { \\mathrm { D E } }$ and $\\frac { \\mathrm { C A } } { \\mathrm { F D } }$ are also equal to 0.6 (or nearly equal to 0.6, if there is some error in the measurement). Thus, ${ \\frac { \\mathrm { A B } } { \\mathrm { D E } } } = { \\frac { \\mathrm { B C } } { \\mathrm { E F } } } = { \\frac { \\mathrm { C A } } { \\mathrm { F D } } }$ You can repeat this activity by constructing several pairs of triangles having their corresponding angles equal. Every time, you will find that their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion). This activity leads us to the following criterion for similarity of two triangles.\n\nTheorem 6.3 : If in two triangles, corresponding angles are equal, then their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion) and hence the two triangles are similar.\n\nThis criterion is referred to as the AAA (Angle–Angle–Angle) criterion of similarity of two triangles.",

    "text": "### 7.1 Introduction\n\nIn Class IX, you have studied that to locate the position of a point on a plane, we require a pair of coordinate axes. The distance of a point from the y-axis is called its $\\mathbf { \\nabla } _ { \\mathbf { x } } .$ -coordinate, or abscissa. The distance of a point from the $x$ -axis is called its y-coordinate, or ordinate. The coordinates of a point on the $x$ -axis are of the form $( x , 0 )$ , and of a point on the y-axis are of the form $( 0 , y )$ .\n\nHere is a play for you. Draw a set of a pair of perpendicular axes on a graph paper. Now plot the following points and join them as directed: Join the point A(4, 8) to B(3, 9) to C(3, 8) to $\\mathrm { D } ( 1 , 6 )$ to $\\operatorname { E } ( 1 , 5 )$ to F(3, 3) to G(6, 3) to H(8, 5) to I(8, 6) to J(6, 8) to K(6, 9) to L(5, 8) to A. Then join the points P(3.5, 7), Q (3, 6) and $\\mathrm { R } ( 4 , 6 )$ to form a triangle. Also join the points X(5.5, 7), Y(5, 6) and $Z ( 6 , 6 )$ to form a triangle. Now join S(4, 5), T(4.5, 4) and U(5, 5) to form a triangle. Lastly join S to the points (0, 5) and $( 0 , 6 )$ and join U to the points (9, 5) and (9, 6). What picture have you got?",

    "text": "Also, you have seen that a linear equation in two variables of the form $a x + b y + c = 0 .$ , $( a , b$ are not simultaneously zero), when represented graphically, gives a straight line. Further, in Chapter 2, you have seen the graph of $y = a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c \\left( a \\neq 0 \\right)$ , is a parabola. In fact, coordinate geometry has been developed as an algebraic tool for studying geometry of figures. It helps us to study geometry using algebra, and understand algebra with the help of geometry. Because of this, coordinate geometry is widely applied in various fields such as physics, engineering, navigation, seismology and art!\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn how to find the distance between the two points whose coordinates are given, and to find the area of the triangle formed by three given points. You will also study how to find the coordinates of the point which divides a line segment joining two given points in a given ratio.",

How would you find the distance from town A to town B without actually measuring it. Let us see. This situation can be represented graphically as shown in Fig. 7.1. You may use the Pythagoras Theorem to calculate this distance.\n\nNow, suppose two points lie on the $x$ -axis. Can we find the distance between them? For instance, consider two points $\\mathrm { A } ( 4 , 0 )$ and $\\mathrm { B } ( 6 , 0 )$ in Fig. 7.2. The points A and B lie on the $x$ -axis.\n\nFrom the figure you can see that $\\mathrm { O A } = 4$ units and $\\mathrm { O B } = 6$ units.\n\nTherefore, the distance of B from A, i.e., AB $= \\mathrm { O B } - \\mathrm { O A } = 6 - 4 = 2$ units.\n\nSo, if two points lie on the $x$ -axis, we can easily find the distance between them.\n\nNow, suppose we take two points lying on the $y .$ -axis. Can you find the distance between them. If the points ${ \\dot { \\mathrm { C } } } ( 0 , 3 )$ and $\\mathrm { D } ( 0 , 8 )$ lie on the $y .$ -axis, similarly we find that $\\mathrm { C D } = 8 - 3 = 5$ units (see Fig. 7.2).\n\n![](images/e8cfb7337681bf8af810b99a0fc27edb3f9c55dde47b099d22e7ea8e9546aace.jpg)  \nFig. 7.1\n\n![](images/fdeff311c204f075a0c567f93b588fddc9c7ee81cc9b3d4381e864d3f7c1a266.jpg)  \nFig. 7.2",

Similarly, you can find the distance of B from $\\mathrm { D } = \\mathrm { B D } = 1 0$ units.\n\nNow, if we consider two points not lying on coordinate axis, can we find the distance between them? Yes! We shall use Pythagoras theorem to do so. Let us see an example.\n\nIn Fig. 7.3, the points $\\mathrm { P } ( 4 , 6 )$ and Q(6, 8) lie in the first quadrant. How do we use Pythagoras theorem to find the distance between them? Let us draw PR and QS perpendicular to the $x$ -axis from P and Q respectively. Also, draw a perpendicular from P on QS to meet QS at T. Then the coordinates of R and S are (4, 0) and (6, 0), respectively. So, ${ \\mathrm { R S } } = 2$ units.

    "text": "The ability to reason and think clearly is extremely useful in our daily life. For example, suppose a politician tells you, ‘If you are interested in a clean government, then you should vote for me.’ What he actually wants you to believe is that if you do not vote for him, then you may not get a clean government. Similarly, if an advertisement tells you, ‘The intelligent wear XYZ shoes’, what the company wants you to conclude is that if you do not wear XYZ shoes, then you are not intelligent enough. You can yourself observe that both the above statements may mislead the general public. So, if we understand the process of reasoning correctly, we do not fall into such traps unknowingly.\n\nThe correct use of reasoning is at the core of mathematics, especially in constructing proofs. In Class IX, you were introduced to the idea of proofs, and you actually proved many statements, especially in geometry. Recall that a proof is made up of several mathematical statements, each of which is logically deduced from a previous statement in the proof, or from a theorem proved earlier, or an axiom, or the hypotheses. The main tool, we use in constructing a proof, is the process of deductive reasoning.\n\nWe start the study of this chapter with a review of what a mathematical statement is. Then, we proceed to sharpen our skills in deductive reasoning using several examples. We shall also deal with the concept of negation and finding the negation of a given statement. Then, we discuss what it means to find the converse of a given statement. Finally, we review the ingredients of a proof learnt in Class IX by analysing the proofs of several theorems. Here, we also discuss the idea of proof by contradiction, which you have come across in Class IX and many other chapters of this book.",

    "text": "In Class IX, you were introduced to the idea of deductive reasoning. Here, we will work with many more examples which will illustrate how deductive reasoning is\n\nused to deduce conclusions from given statements that we assume to be true. The given statements are called ‘premises’ or ‘hypotheses’. We begin with some examples.\n\nExample $5 :$ Given that Bijapur is in the state of Karnataka, and suppose Shabana lives in Bijapur. In which state does Shabana live?\n\nSolution : Here we have two premises:\n\n(i) Bijapur is in the state of Karnataka\n\n(ii) Shabana lives in Bijapur\n\nFrom these premises, we deduce that Shabana lives in the state of Karnataka.\n\nExample $6 :$ Given that all mathematics textbooks are interesting, and suppose you are reading a mathematics textbook. What can we conclude about the textbook you are reading?\n\nSolution : Using the two premises (or hypotheses), we can deduce that you are reading an interesting textbook.\n\nExample 7 : Given that $y = - 6 x + 5$ , and suppose $x = 3$ . What is y?\n\nSolution : Given the two hypotheses, we get $y = - 6 ( 3 ) + 5 = - 1 3 .$\n\nExample $\\mathbf { 8 : }$ Given that ABCD is a parallelogram, and suppose $\\mathrm { A D } = 5 \\mathrm { c m } , \\mathrm { A B } = 7 \\mathrm { c m }$ (see Fig. A1.1). What can you conclude about the lengths of DC and BC?\n\nSolution : We are given that ABCD is a parallelogram. So, we deduce that all the properties that hold for a parallelogram hold for ABCD. Therefore, in particular,\n\n![](images/d82d61efab68bac27d6cc0b42e47ed3fdd3e17719fe2276b60e2a5da8e483856.jpg)  \nFig. A1.1\n\nthe property that ‘the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal to each other’, holds.

What really matters here is that we use the correct process of reasoning, and this process of reasoning does not depend on the trueness or falsity of the hypotheses. However, it must also be noted that if we start with an incorrect premise (or hypothesis), we may arrive at a wrong conclusion.",

This seems an extremely sensible guess, and one can check that if $n = 5$ , we do get 16 regions. So, having verified this formula for 5 points, are you satisfied that for any $n$ points there are $2 ^ { n - 1 }$ regions? If so, how would you respond, if someone asked you, how you can be sure about this for $n = 2 5$ , say? To deal with such questions, you would need a proof which shows beyond doubt that this result is true, or a counter-example to show that this result fails for some $\\overrightarrow { \\mathbf { \\nabla } n } \\overrightarrow { \\mathbf { \\nabla } }$ . Actually, if you are patient and try it out for $n = 6$ , you will find that there are 31 regions, and for $n = 7$ there are 57 regions. So, $n =$ 6, is a counter-example to the conjecture above. This demonstrates the power of a counterexample. You may recall that in the Class IX we discussed that to disprove a statement, it is enough to come up with a single counter-example.",

To establish its validity, it is not enough to verify the result for $n = 1 , 2 , 3$ and so on, because there may be some $ { { ^ \\circ } n \\mathrm { \\ ' } }$ for which this result is not true (just as in the example above, the result failed for $n = 6$ ). What we need is a proof which establishes its truth beyond doubt. You shall learn a proof for the same in higher classes.\n\nNow, consider Fig. A1.3, where PQ and PR are tangents to the circle drawn from P.\n\nYou have proved that PQ = PR (Theorem 10.2).

    "text": "In this section, we discuss what it means to ‘negate’ a statement. Before we start, we would like to introduce some notation, which will make it easy for us to understand these concepts. To start with, let us look at a statement as a single unit, and give it a name. For example, we can denote the statement ‘It rained in Delhi on 1 September $2 0 0 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { b y } p$ . We can also write this by\n\n$p$ : It rained in Delhi on 1 September 2005.\n\nSimilarly, let us write\n\nq: All teachers are female.\n\nr: Mike’s dog has a black tail.\n\n$$\ns: 2 + 2 = 4.\n$$\n\nt : Triangle ABC is equilateral.\n\nThis notation now helps us to discuss properties of statements, and also to see how we can combine them.

    "text": "Each new statement in the table is a negation of the corresponding old statement. That is, $\\displaystyle { \\sim } p , \\sim q , \\sim r , \\sim s$ and ${ \\sim } t$ are negations of the statements $p , q , r , s$ and $t$ , respectively. Here, ${ \\sim } p$ is read as ‘not $p '$ . The statement ${ \\sim } p$ negates the assertion that the statement $p$ makes. Notice that in our usual talk we would simply mean ${ \\sim } p$ as ‘It did not rain in Delhi on 1 September 2005.’ However, we need to be careful while doing so. You might think that one can obtain the negation of a statement by simply inserting the word ‘not’ in the given statement at a suitable place. While this works in the case of $p$ , the difficulty comes when we have a statement that begins with ‘all’. Consider, for example, the statement $q$ : All teachers are female. We said the negation of this statement is ${ \\sim } q$ : It is false that all teachers are female. This is the same as the statement ‘There are some teachers who are males.’ Now let us see what happens if we simply insert ‘not’ in $q$ . We obtain the statement: ‘All teachers are not female’, or we can obtain the statement: ‘Not all teachers are female.’ The first statement can confuse people. It could imply (if we lay emphasis on the word ‘All’) that all teachers are male! This is certainly not the negation of $q$ . However, the second statement gives the meaning of ${ \\sim } q$ , i.e., that there is at least one teacher who is not a female. So, be careful when writing the negation of a statement!\n\nSo, how do we decide that we have the correct negation? We use the following criterion.\n\nLet p be a statement and ${ \\sim } p$ its negation. Then ~p is false whenever p is true, and ${ \\sim } p$ is true whenever p is false.\n\nFor example, if it is true that Mike’s dog has a black tail, then it is false that Mike’s dog does not have a black tail. If it is false that ‘Mike’s dog has a black tail’, then it is true that ‘Mike’s dog does not have a black tail’.",

    "text": "We now investigate the notion of the converse of a statement. For this, we need the notion of a ‘compound’ statement, that is, a statement which is a combination of one or more ‘simple’ statements. There are many ways of creating compound statements, but we will focus on those that are created by connecting two simple statements with the use of the words ‘if’ and ‘then’. For example, the statement ‘If it is raining, then it is difficult to go on a bicycle’, is made up of two statements:\n\n$p$ : It is raining\n\n$q$ : It is difficult to go on a bicycle.\n\nUsing our previous notation we can say: If $p$ , then $q$ . We can also say $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { p } }$ implies $q ^ { , }$ , and denote it by $p \\Longrightarrow q$ .\n\nNow, supose you have the statement ‘If the water tank is black, then it contains potable water.’ This is of the form $p \\Longrightarrow q$ , where the hypothesis is $p$ (the water tank is black) and the conclusion is $q$ (the tank contains potable water). Suppose we interchange the hypothesis and the conclusion, what do we get? We get $q \\Rightarrow p$ , i.e., if the water in the tank is potable, then the tank must be black. This statement is called the converse of the statement $p \\Longrightarrow q$ .\n\nIn general, the converse of the statement $p \\Longrightarrow q$ is $q \\Rightarrow p$ , where $p$ and $q$ are statements. Note that $p \\Longrightarrow q$ and $q \\Rightarrow p$ are the converses of each other.\n\nExample 13 : Write the converses of the following statements :",

    "text": "So far, in all our examples, we used direct arguments to establish the truth of the results. We now explore ‘indirect’ arguments, in particular, a very powerful tool in mathematics known as ‘proof by contradiction’. We have already used this method in Chapter 1 to establish the irrationality of several numbers and also in other chapters to prove some theorems. Here, we do several more examples to illustrate the idea.\n\nBefore we proceed, let us explain what a contradiction is. In mathematics, a contradiction occurs when we get a statement $p$ such that $p$ is true and ${ \\sim } p$ , its negation, is also true. For example,\n\np: $x = \\frac { a } { b }$ , where $a$ and $b$ are coprime.\n\nq: 2 divides both $ { { ^ \\circ } } a ^ { \\prime }$ and $^ { \\circ } b ^ { \\prime }$ .\n\nIf we assume that $p$ is true and also manage to show that $q$ is true, then we have arrived at a contradiction, because $q$ implies that the negation of $\\dot { p }$ is true. If you remember, this is exactly what happened when we tried to prove that $\\sqrt { 2 }$ is irrational (see Chapter 1).\n\nHow does proof by contradiction work? Let us see this through a specific example.\n\nSuppose we are given the following :\n\nAll women are mortal. A is a woman. Prove that A is mortal.\n\nEven though this is a rather easy example, let us see how we can prove this by contradiction.\n\nl Let us assume that we want to establish the truth of a statement $p$ (here we want to show that $p \\colon ^ { \\bullet } \\mathbf { A }$ is mortal’ is true).",

(Since A is not mortal, we have a counter-example to the statement ‘All women are mortal.’ Hence, it is false that all women are mortal.)   \nIf this leads to a contradiction, then the contradiction arises because of our faulty assumption that $p$ is not true.
