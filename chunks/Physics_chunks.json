    "text": "Activity 1.1 can be described as – when a magnesium ribbon is burnt in oxygen, it gets converted to magnesium oxide. This description of a chemical reaction in a sentence form is quite long. It can be written in a shorter form. The simplest way to do this is to write it in the form of a word-equation.\n\nThe word-equation for the above reaction would be –\n\nMagnesium + Oxygen®Magnesium oxide\n\n(Reactants) (Product) (1.1)\n\nThe substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction (1.1), magnesium and oxygen, are the reactants. The new substance is magnesium oxide, formed during the reaction, as a product. A word-equation shows change of reactants to products through an arrow placed between them. The reactants are written on the left-hand side (LHS) with a plus sign $( + )$ between them. Similarly, products are written on the right-hand side (RHS) with a plus sign $( + )$ between them. The arrowhead points towards the products, and shows the direction of the reaction.\n\n#### 1.1.1 Writing a Chemical Equation\n\nIs there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations? Chemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use chemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a chemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and magnesium oxide, the above wordequation can be written as –\n\n$$\n\\mathrm {M g} + \\mathrm {O} _ {2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm {M g O} \\tag {1.2}\n$$\n\nCount and compare the number of atoms of each element on the LHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the same on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced. If not, then the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on both sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal chemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical equation for the burning of magnesium in air.\n\n#### 1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations\n\nRecall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the total mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction has to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.",

    "text": "#### 1.3.1 Corrosion\n\nYou must have observed that iron articles are shiny when new, but get coated with a reddish brown powder when left for some time. This process is commonly known as rusting of iron. Some other metals also get tarnished in this manner. Have you noticed the colour of the coating formed on copper and silver? When a metal is attacked by substances around it such as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and this process is called corrosion. The black coating on silver and the green coating on copper are other examples of corrosion.\n\nCorrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges, iron railings, ships and to all objects made of metals, specially those of iron. Corrosion of iron is a serious problem. Every\n\nyear an enormous amount of money is spent to replace damaged iron. You will learn more about corrosion in Chapter 3.\n\n#### 1.3.2 Rancidity\n\nHave you ever tasted or smelt the fat/oil containing food materials left for a long time?\n\nWhen fats and oils are oxidised, they become rancid and their smell and taste change. Usually s u b s t a n c e s w h i c h p r e v e n t o x i d a t i o n (antioxidants) are added to foods containing fats and oil. Keeping food in air tight containers helps to slow down oxidation. Do you know that chips manufacturers usually flush bags of chips with gas such as nitrogen to prevent the chips from getting oxidised ?",

Litmus is a\n\nnatural indicator, turmeric is another such indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth becomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed on it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of water. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and phenolphthalein to test for acids and bases.\n\nIn this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how acids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting things that we use and see in our day-to-day life.",

Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric acid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly to water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid, the heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating.

    "text": "We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between an acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about dilution and decrease in concentration of $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ or $\\mathrm { O H } ^ { - }$ ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is?\n\nWe can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a mixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different colours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.\n\nA scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called pH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German, meaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a number which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher the hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value.\n\nThe pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale represent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it represents an increase in $\\mathrm { O H } ^ { - }$ ion concentration in the solution, that is, increase in the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6). Generally paper impregnated with the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.\n\n![](images/be7d255581298461ce9d86b89f76ca453d62a12bb6c215f5097560ad0fc10dd6.jpg)  \nFigure 2.6 + –Variation of pH with the change in concentration of H (aq) and OH (aq) ions",

At ordinary temperature, the surfaces of metals such as magnesium, aluminium, zinc, lead, etc., are covered with a thin layer of oxide. The protective oxide layer prevents the metal from further oxidation. Iron does not burn on heating but iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled in the flame of the burner.

This aluminium oxide coat makes it resistant to further corrosion. The resistance can be improved further by making the oxide layer thicker. During anodising, a clean aluminium article is made the anode and is electrolysed with dilute sulphuric acid. The oxygen gas evolved at the anode reacts with aluminium to make a thicker protective oxide layer. This oxide layer can be dyed easily to give aluminium articles an attractive finish.\n\nAfter performing Activity 3.9, you must have observed that sodium is the most reactive of the samples of metals taken here.

We, therefore, explain the reactivity of elements as a tendency to attain a completely filled valence shell.\n\nLet us have a look at the electronic configuration of noble gases and some metals and non-metals.\n\nWe can see from Table 3.3 that a sodium atom has one electron in its outermost shell. If it loses the electron from its M shell then its L shell now becomes the outermost shell and that has a stable octet. The nucleus of this atom still has 11 protons but the number of electrons has become 10, so there is a net positive charge giving us a sodium cation $\\mathrm { N a + }$ .

These compounds are generally brittle and break into pieces when pressure is applied.   \n(ii) Melting and Boiling points: Ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points (see Table 3.4). This is because a considerable amount of energy is required to break the strong inter-ionic attraction.   \n(iii) Solubility: Electrovalent compounds are generally soluble in water and insoluble in solvents such as kerosene, petrol, etc.   \n(iv) Conduction of Electricity: The conduction of electricity through a solution involves the movement of charged particles. A solution of an ionic compound in water contains ions, which move to the opposite electrodes when electricity is passed through the solution. Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conduct electricity because movement of ions in the solid is not possible due to their rigid structure. But ionic compounds conduct electricity in the molten state. This is possible in the molten state since the elecrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions are overcome due to the heat.

Seawater also contains some soluble salts such as sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, etc. The elements or compounds, which occur naturally in the earth’s crust, are known as minerals. At some places, minerals contain a very high percentage of a particular metal and the metal can be profitably extracted from it. These minerals are called ores.\n\n#### 3.4.1 Extraction of Metals\n\nYou have learnt about the reactivity series of metals. Having this knowledge, you can easily understand how a metal is extracted from its ore. Some metals are found in the earth’s crust in the free state. Some are found in the form of their compounds. The metals at the bottom of the activity series are the least reactive. They are often found in a free state. For example, gold, silver, platinum and copper are found in the free state. Copper and silver are also found in the combined state as their sulphide or oxide ores. The metals at the top of the activity series (K, Na, Ca, Mg and Al) are so reactive that they are never found in nature as free elements.\n\n![](images/09c9fd18fe71c33836f4407c72e9470e9e7acbffb0fafc850921ce9fe2ca06c6.jpg)  \nFigure 3.9 Activity series and related metallurgy\n\nThe metals in the middle of the activity series (Zn, Fe, Pb, etc.) are moderately reactive. They are found in the earth’s crust mainly as oxides, sulphides or carbonates. You will find that the ores of many metals are oxides. This is because oxygen is a very reactive element and is very abundant on the earth.\n\nThus on the basis of reactivity, we can group the metals into the following three categories (Fig. 3.9) – (i) Metals of low reactivity; (ii) Metals of medium reactivity; (iii) Metals of high reactivity. Different techniques are to be used for obtaining the metals falling in each category.\n\nSeveral steps are involved in the extraction of pure metal from ores. A summary of these steps is given in Fig.3.10. Each step is explained in detail in the following sections.\n\n![](images/59cb5646aeef92b77a3fa6a7df6c151fbe3c72988050f843870fff6944d42db1.jpg)",

The impurities must be removed from the ore prior to the extraction of the metal. The processes\n\nused for removing the gangue from the ore are based on the differences between the physical or chemical properties of the gangue and the ore. Different separation techniques are accordingly employed.\n\n#### 3.4.3 Extracting Metals Low in the Activity Series\n\nMetals low in the activity series are very unreactive. The oxides of these metals can be reduced to metals by heating alone. For example, cinnabar (HgS) is an ore of mercury. When it is heated in air, it is first converted into mercuric oxide (HgO). Mercuric oxide is then reduced to mercury on further heating.\n\n$$\n2 \\mathrm {H g S} (\\mathrm {s}) + 3 \\mathrm {O} _ {2} (\\mathrm {g}) \\xrightarrow {\\text {H e a t}} 2 \\mathrm {H g O} (\\mathrm {s}) + 2 \\mathrm {S O} _ {2} (\\mathrm {g})\n$$\n\n$$\n2 \\mathrm {H g O} (\\mathrm {s}) \\xrightarrow {\\text {H e a t}} 2 \\mathrm {H g} (\\mathrm {l}) + \\mathrm {O} _ {2} (\\mathrm {g})\n$$\n\nSimilarly, copper which is found as $\\mathrm { C u } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { S }$ in nature can be obtained from its ore by just heating in air.\n\n$$\n2 \\mathrm {C u} _ {2} \\mathrm {S} + 3 \\mathrm {O} _ {2} (\\mathrm {g}) \\xrightarrow {\\text {H e a t}} 2 \\mathrm {C u} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} (\\mathrm {s}) + 2 \\mathrm {S O} _ {2} (\\mathrm {g})\n$$",

These are usually present as sulphides or carbonates in nature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide, as compared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to reduction, the metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal oxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating strongly in the presence of excess air. This process is known as roasting. The carbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited air. This process is known as calcination. The chemical reaction that takes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown as follows – Roasting\n\n$$\n2 \\mathrm {Z n S (s)} + 3 \\mathrm {O} _ {2} (\\mathrm {g}) \\xrightarrow {\\text {H e a t}} 2 \\mathrm {Z n O (s)} + 2 \\mathrm {S O} _ {2} (\\mathrm {g})\n$$\n\nCalcination\n\n$$\n\\mathrm {Z n C O} _ {3} (\\mathrm {s}) \\xrightarrow {\\text {H e a t}} \\mathrm {Z n O} (\\mathrm {s}) + \\mathrm {C O} _ {2} (\\mathrm {g})\n$$\n\nThe metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by using suitable reducing agents such as carbon. For example, when zinc oxide is heated with carbon, it is reduced to metallic zinc.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm {Z n O (s) + C (s) \\rightarrow Z n (s) + C O (g)}\n$$\n\nYou are already familiar with the process of oxidation and reduction explained in the first Chapter. Obtaining metals from their compounds is also a reduction process.",

For example, carbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium, calcium, aluminium, etc., to the respective metals. This is because these metals have more affinity for oxygen than carbon. These metals are obtained by electrolytic reduction. For example, sodium, magnesium and calcium are obtained by the electrolysis of their molten chlorides. The metals are deposited at the cathode (the negatively charged electrode), whereas, chlorine is liberated at the anode (the positively charged electrode). The reactions are –\n\nAt cathode\n\nAt anode\n\nSimilarly, aluminium is obtained by the electrolytic reduction of aluminium oxide.\n\n#### 3.4.6 Refining of Metals\n\nThe metals produced by various reduction processes described above are not very pure.

We saw that ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points and conduct electricity in solution or in the molten state. We also\n\nsaw how the nature of bonding in ionic compounds explains these properties. Let us now study the properties of some carbon compounds.\n\nMost carbon compounds are poor conductors of electricity as we have seen in Chapter 2. From the data given in Table 4.1 on the boiling and melting points of the carbon compounds, we find that these compounds have low melting and boiling points as compared to ionic compounds (Chapter 3). We can conclude that the forces of attraction between the molecules are not very strong. Since these compounds are largely nonconductors of electricity, we can conclude that the bonding in these compounds does not give rise to any ions.\n\nTable 4.1 Melting points and boiling points of some compounds of carbon   \n\n<table><tr><td>Compound</td><td>Melting point (K)</td><td>Boiling point (K)</td></tr><tr><td>Acetic acid (CH3COOH)</td><td>290</td><td>391</td></tr><tr><td>Chloroform (CHCl3)</td><td>209</td><td>334</td></tr><tr><td>Ethanol (CH3CH2OH)</td><td>156</td><td>351</td></tr><tr><td>Methane (CH4)</td><td>90</td><td>111</td></tr></table>\n\nIn Class IX, we learnt about the combining capacity of various elements and how it depends on the number of valence electrons. Let us now look at the electronic configuration of carbon. The atomic number of carbon is 6. What would be the distribution of electrons in various shells of carbon? How many valence electrons will carbon have?\n\nWe know that the reactivity of elements is explained as their tendency to attain a completely filled outer shell, that is, attain noble gas configuration. Elements forming ionic compounds achieve this by either gaining or losing electrons from the outermost shell. In the case of carbon, it has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs to gain or lose four electrons to attain noble gas configuration. If it were to gain or lose electrons –",

But it would require a large amount of energy to remove four electrons leaving behind a carbon cation with six protons in its nucleus holding on to just two electrons.\n\nCarbon overcomes this problem by sharing its valence electrons with other atoms of carbon or with atoms of other elements. Not just carbon, but many other elements form molecules by sharing electrons in this manner. The shared electrons ‘belong’ to the outermost shells of both the atoms and lead to both atoms attaining the noble gas configuration. Before going on to compounds of carbon, let us look at some simple molecules formed by the sharing of valence electrons.\n\nThe simplest molecule formed in this manner is that of hydrogen. As you have learnt earlier, the atomic number of hydrogen is 1. Hence hydrogen has one electron in its K shell and it requires one more electron to fill the K shell. So two hydrogen atoms share their electrons to form a molecule of hydrogen, $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ .

A single covalent bond is also represented by a line between the two atoms, as shown in Fig. 4.2.\n\n![](images/239e2da3bd54b3ac266cf1be67ad1b7c53accb3a0d06adb83cebe97ee62067c3.jpg)  \nFigure 4.2 Single bond between two hydrogen atoms",

This is because an atom of oxygen has six electrons in its L shell (the atomic number of oxygen is eight) and it requires two more electrons to complete its octet. So each atom of oxygen shares two electrons with another atom of oxygen to give us the structure shown in Fig. 4.3.

What would be the electron dot structure of a molecule of sulphur which is made up of eight atoms of sulphur? (Hint – The eight atoms of sulphur are joined together in the form of a ring.)\n\n### 4.2 VERSATILE NATURE OFCARBON\n\nWe have seen the formation of covalent bonds by the sharing of electrons in various elements and compounds. We have also seen the structure of a simple carbon compound, methane. In the beginning of the Chapter, we saw how many things we use contain carbon. In fact, we ourselves are made up of carbon compounds. The numbers of carbon compounds whose formulae are known to chemists was recently estimated to be in millions! This outnumbers by a large margin the compounds formed by all the other elements put together. Why is it that this property is seen in carbon and no other element? The nature of the covalent bond\n\nenables carbon to form a large number of compounds. Two factors noticed in the case of carbon are –\n\n(i) Carbon has the unique ability to form bonds with other atoms of carbon, giving rise to large molecules. This property is called catenation. These compounds may have long chains of carbon, branched chains of carbon or even carbon atoms arranged in rings. In addition, carbon atoms may be linked by single, double or triple bonds. Compounds of carbon, which are linked by only single bonds between the carbon atoms are called saturated compounds. Compounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between their carbon atoms are called unsaturated compounds.   \nNo other element exhibits the property of catenation to the extent seen in carbon compounds. Silicon forms compounds with hydrogen which have chains of upto seven or eight atoms, but these compounds are very reactive. The carbon-carbon bond is very strong and hence stable. This gives us the large number of compounds with many carbon atoms linked to each other.   \n(ii) Since carbon has a valency of four, it is capable of bonding with four other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other mono-valent element. Compounds of carbon are formed with oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, chlorine and many other elements giving rise to compounds with specific properties which depend on the elements other than carbon present in the molecule.",

    "text": "The two characteristic features seen in carbon, that is, tetravalency and catenation, put together give rise to a large number of compounds. Many have the same noncarbon atom or group of atoms attached to different carbon chains. These compounds were initially extracted from natural substances and it was thought that these carbon compounds or organic compounds could only be formed within a living system. That is, it was postulated that a ‘vital force’ was necessary for their synthesis. Friedrich Wöhler disproved this in 1828 by preparing urea from ammonium cyanate. But carbon compounds, except for carbides, oxides of carbon, carbonate and hydrogencarbonate salts continue to be studied under organic chemistry.\n\n#### 4.2.1 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds\n\nWe have already seen the structure of methane. Another compound formed between carbon and hydrogen is ethane with a formula of $\\mathrm { C } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { H } _ { 6 }$ . In order to arrive at the structure of simple carbon compounds, the first step is to link the carbon atoms together with a single bond (Fig. 4.6a) and then use the hydrogen atoms to satisfy the remaining valencies of carbon (Fig. 4.6b). For example, the structure of ethane is arrived in the following steps –\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l} \\mathrm {C} - \\mathrm {C} & \\mathrm {S t e p 1} \\end{array}\n$$\n\nFigure 4.6 (a)\n\nCarbon atoms linked together with a single bond\n\nThree valencies of each carbon atom remain unsatisfied, so each is bonded to three hydrogen atoms giving:\n\n![](images/b765885ef59e1341c4a7b3cb700a797483eaf9e065f0540f98ca865ed41685c2.jpg)  \nFigure 4.6 (b)   \nEach carbon atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms\n\n![](images/322e9564d73fc573bb8c427c5198c8dd74476739790f0ec6c20fa99ee601411b.jpg)  \nFigure 4.6 (c)   \nElectron dot structure of ethane\n\nThe electron dot structure of ethane is shown in Fig. 4.6(c).",

Ethanol is commonly called alcohol and is the active ingredient of all alcoholic drinks. In addition, because it is a\n\ngood solvent, it is also used in medicines such as tincture iodine, cough syrups, and many tonics. Ethanol is also soluble in water in all proportions. Consumption of small quantities of dilute ethanol causes drunkenness. Even though this practice is condemned, it is a socially widespread practice.

Methanol is oxidised to methanal in the liver. Methanal reacts rapidly with the components of cells. It coagulates the protoplasm, in much the same way an egg is coagulated by cooking. Methanol also affects the optic nerve, causing blindness. Ethanol is an important industrial solvent. To prevent the misuse of ethanol produced for industrial use, it is made unfit for drinking by adding poisonous substances like methanol to it.

Most dirt is oily in nature and as you know, oil does not dissolve in water. The molecules of soap are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain carboxylic acids. The ionicend of soap interacts with water while the carbon chain interacts with oil. The soap molecules, thus form structures called micelles (see Fig. 4.12) where one end of the molecules is towards the oil droplet while the ionic-end faces outside. This forms an emulsion in water. The soap micelle thus helps in pulling out the dirt in water and we can wash our clothes clean (Fig. 4.13).\n\nCan you draw the structure of the micelle that would be formed if you dissolve soap in a hydrocarbon?",

During the day, the sunlight helps us to see objects. An object reflects light that falls on it. This reflected light, when received by our eyes, enables us to see things. We are able to see through a transparent medium as light is transmitted through it. There are a number of common wonderful phenomena associated with light such as image formation by mirrors, the twinkling of stars, the beautiful colours of a rainbow, bending of light by a medium and so on. A study of the properties of light helps us to explore them.\n\nBy observing the common optical phenomena around us, we may conclude that light seems to travel in straight lines. The fact that a small source of light casts a sharp shadow of an opaque object points to this straight-line path of light, usually indicated as a ray of light.",

    "text": "If an opaque object on the path of light becomes very small, light has a tendency to bend around it and not walk in a straight line – an effect known as the diffraction of light. Then the straight-line treatment of optics using rays fails. To explain phenomena such as diffraction, light is thought of as a wave, the details of which you will study in higher classes. Again, at the beginning of the 20th century, it became known that the wave theory of light often becomes inadequate for treatment of the interaction of light with\n\nmatter, and light often behaves somewhat like a stream of particles. This confusion about the true nature of light continued for some years till a modern quantum theory of light emerged in which light is neither a ‘wave’ nor a ‘particle’ – the new theory reconciles the particle properties of light with the wave nature.\n\nIn this Chapter, we shall study the phenomena of reflection and refraction of light using the straight-line propagation of light. These basic concepts will help us in the study of some of the optical phenomena in nature. We shall try to understand in this Chapter the reflection of light by spherical mirrors and refraction of light and their application in real life situations.",

    "text": "Convex mirrors are commonly used as rear-view (wing) mirrors in vehicles. These mirrors are fitted on the sides of the vehicle, enabling the driver to see traffic behind him/her to facilitate safe driving. Convex mirrors are preferred because they always give an erect, though diminished, image. Also, they have a wider field of view as they are curved outwards. Thus, convex mirrors enable the driver to view much larger area than would be possible with a plane mirror.\n\n## \n\n1. Define the principal focus of a concave mirror.   \n2. The radius of curvature of a spherical mirror is $2 0 \\mathrm { c m }$ . What is its focal length?   \n3. Name a mirror that can give an erect and enlarged image of an object.   \n4. Why do we prefer a convex mirror as a rear-view mirror in vehicles?\n\n#### 9.2.3 Sign Convention for Reflection by Spherical Mirrors\n\nWhile dealing with the reflection of light by spherical mirrors, we shall follow a set of sign conventions called the New Cartesian Sign Convention. In this convention, the pole (P) of the mirror is taken as the origin (Fig. 9.9). The principal axis of the mirror is taken as the x-axis $( \\mathrm { { X } } ^ { \\prime } \\mathrm { { X } } )$ of the coordinate system. The conventions are as follows –\n\n(i) The object is always placed to the left of the mirror. This implies that the light from the object falls on the mirror from the lefthand side.   \n(ii) All distances parallel to the principal axis are measured from the pole of the mirror.   \n(iii) All the distances measured to the right of the origin (along + x-axis) are taken as positive while those measured to the left of the origin (along – x-axis) are taken as negative.   \n(iv) Distances measured perpendicular to and above the principal axis (along + y-axis) are taken as positive.   \n(v) Distances measured perpendicular to and below the principal axis (along –y-axis) are taken as negative.\n\nThe New Cartesian Sign Convention described above is illustrated in Fig.9.9 for your reference. These sign conventions are applied to obtain the mirror formula and solve related numerical problems.",

    "text": "Light seems to travel along straight-line paths in a transparent medium. What happens when light enters from one transparent medium to another? Does it still move along a straightline path or change its direction? We shall recall some of our day-to-day experiences.\n\nYou might have observed that the bottom of a tank or a pond containing water appears to be raised. Similarly, when a thick glass slab is placed over some printed matter, the letters appear raised when viewed through the glass slab. Why does it happen? Have you seen a pencil partly immersed in water in a glass tumbler? It appears to be displaced at the interface of air and water. You might have observed that a lemon kept in water in a glass tumbler appears to be bigger than its actual size, when viewed from the sides. How can you account for such experiences?\n\nLet us consider the case of the apparent displacement of a pencil, partly immersed in water. The light reaching you from the portion of the pencil inside water seems to come from a different direction, compared to the part above water. This makes the pencil appear to be displaced at the interface. For similar reasons, the letters appear to be raised, when seen through a glass slab placed over it.\n\nDoes a pencil appear to be displaced to the same extent, if instead of water, we use liquids like kerosene or turpentine? Will the letters appear to rise to the same height if we replace a glass slab with a transparent plastic slab? You will find that the extent of the effect is different for different pair of media. These observations indicate that light does not travel in the same direction in all media. It appears that when travelling obliquely from one medium to another, the direction of propagation of light in the second medium changes. This phenomenon is known as refraction of light. Let us understand this phenomenon further by doing a few activities.",

OO is theI refracted ray and $\\mathrm { o } ^ { \\mathrm { \\prime } } \\mathrm { H }$ is the emergent ray. You may observe that the emergent ray is parallel to the direction of the incident ray. Why does it happen so? The extent of bending of the ray of light at the opposite parallel faces AB (air-glass interface) and CD (glass-air interface) of the rectangular glass slab is equal and opposite. This is why the ray emerges parallel to the incident ray. However, the light ray is shifted sideward slightly. What happens when a light ray is incident normally to the interface of two media? Try and find out.\n\n![](images/008996e0b324a46ed80aa786b4200e291383501973a21fab1194e3ff5f06de8d.jpg)  \nFigure 9.10 Refraction of light through a rectangular glass slab\n\nNow you are familiar with the refraction of light. Refraction is due to change in the speed of light as it enters from one transparent medium to another. Experiments show that refraction of light occurs according to certain laws.\n\nThe following are the laws of refraction of light.\n\n(i) The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interface of two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.   \n(ii) The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is a constant, for the light of a given colour and for the given pair of media. This law is also known as Snell’s law of refraction. (This is true for angle $0 < \\mathrm { i } < 9 0 ^ { \\mathrm { o } }$ )\n\nIf i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction, then,\n\n$$\n\\frac {\\sin i}{\\sin r} = \\text {c o n s t a n t} \\tag {9.4}\n$$\n\nThis constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first.

    "text": "You have already studied that a ray of light that travels obliquely from one transparent medium into another will change its direction in the second medium. The extent of the change in direction that takes place in a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index, the “constant” appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4).\n\nThe refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity, the relative speed of propagation of light in different media. It turns out that light propagates with different speeds in different media. Light travels fastest in vacuum with speed of $3 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { 8 } \\mathrm { m } \\mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ . In air, the speed of light is only marginally less, compared\n\nto that in vacuum. It reduces considerably in glass or water. The value of the refractive index for a given pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as given below.\n\nConsider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as shown in Fig.9.11. Let $\\mathbf { V } _ { 1 }$ be the speed of light in medium 1 and $\\mathbf { V } _ { 2 }$ be the speed of light in medium 2. The refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and the speed of light in medium 2. This is usually represented by the symbol $\\mathbf { n } _ { 2 1 }$ . This can be expressed in an equation form as\n\n$$\nn _ {2 1} = \\frac {\\text {S p e e d o f l i g h t i n m e d i u m 1}}{\\text {S p e e d o f l i g h t i n m e d i u m 2}} = \\frac {v _ {1}}{v _ {2}} \\tag {9.5}\n$$\n\n![](images/08eca54c0201b0eb95f5eef28fe3f31c547a7981ae518526863aaaf0402cb0d5.jpg)  \nFigure 9.11",

    "text": "The ability of a medium to refract light is also expressed in terms of its optical density. Optical density has a definite connotation. It is not the same as mass density. We have been using the terms ‘rarer medium’ and ‘denser medium’ in this Chapter. It actually means ‘optically rarer medium’ and ‘optically denser medium’, respectively. When can we say that a medium is optically denser than the other? In comparing two media, the one with the larger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other. The other medium of lower refractive index is optically rarer. The speed of light is higher in a rarer medium than a denser medium. Thus, a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to a denser medium slows down and bends towards the normal. When it travels from a denser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal.\n\n## \n\n1. A ray of light travelling in air enters obliquely into water. Does the light ray bend towards the normal or away from the normal? Why?   \n2. Light enters from air to glass having refractive index 1.50. What is the speed of light in the glass? The speed of light in vacuum is $3 \\times 1 0 ^ { 8 } \\mathrm { m } \\mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ .   \n3. Find out, from Table 9.3, the medium having highest optical density. Also find the medium with lowest optical density.   \n4. You are given kerosene, turpentine and water. In which of these does the light travel fastest? Use the information given in Table 9.3.   \n5. The refractive index of diamond is 2.42. ? What is the meaning of this statement?\n\n#### 9.3.3 Refraction by Spherical Lenses\n\nYou might have seen watchmakers using a small magnifying glass to see tiny parts. Have you ever touched the surface of a magnifying glass with your hand? Is it plane surface or curved? Is it thicker in the middle or at the edges? The glasses used in spectacles and that by a watchmaker are examples of lenses. What is a lens? How does it bend light rays? We shall discuss these in this section.",

The light from the Sun constitutes parallel rays of light. These rays were converged by the lens at the sharp bright spot formed on the paper. In fact, the bright spot you got on the paper is a real image of the Sun. The concentration of the sunlight at a point generated heat. This caused the paper to burn.\n\nNow, we shall consider rays of light parallel to the principal axis of a lens. What happens when you pass such rays of light through a lens?

Thus, a real, inverted image, 4 cm tall, is formed at a distance of 30 cm on the other side of the lens. The image is two times enlarged.\n\n#### 9.3.8 Power of a Lens\n\nYou have already learnt that the ability of a lens to converge or diverge light rays depends on its focal length. For example, a convex lens of short focal length bends the light rays through large angles, by focussing them closer to the optical centre. Similarly, concave lens of very short focal length causes higher divergence than the one with longer focal length. The degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved by a lens is expressed in terms of its power. The power of a lens is defined as the reciprocal of its focal length. It is represented by the letter $P$ . The power $P$ of a lens of focal length f is given by\n\n$$\nP = \\frac {1}{f} \\tag {9.11}\n$$\n\nThe SI unit of power of a lens is ‘dioptre’. It is denoted by the letter D. If f is expressed in metres, then, power is expressed in dioptres. Thus, 1 dioptre is the power of a lens whose focal length is 1 metre. $1 \\mathrm { D } { = } 1 \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 }$ . You may note that the power of a convex lens is positive and that of a concave lens is negative.\n\nOpticians prescribe corrective lenses indicating their powers. Let us say the lens prescribed has power equal to $+ 2 . 0 \\textrm { D }$ . This means the lens prescribed is convex. The focal length of the lens $\\mathrm { i s } + 0 . 5 0 \\mathrm { m }$ . Similarly, a lens of power – 2.5 D has a focal length of $- 0 . 4 0 \\mathrm { m }$ . The lens is concave.",

The net power (P) of the lenses placed in contact is given by the algebraic sum of the individual powers $\\mathrm { { P } } _ { 1 }$ , $\\mathrm { P } _ { 2 } , \\mathrm { P } _ { 3 } , \\ldots$ as\n\n$$\n\\mathbf {P} = \\mathbf {P} _ {1} + \\mathbf {P} _ {2} + \\mathbf {P} _ {3} + \\dots\n$$\n\nThe use of powers, instead of focal lengths, for lenses is quite convenient for opticians. During eye-testing, an optician puts several different combinations of corrective lenses of known power, in contact, inside the testing spectacles’ frame. The optician calculates the power of the lens required by simple algebraic addition. For example, a combination of two lenses of power $+ 2 . 0 \\mathrm { D }$ and $+ 0 . 2 5 \\mathrm { D }$ is equivalent to a single lens of power $+ 2 . 2 5 \\mathrm { D }$ .\n\nThe simple additive property of the powers of lenses can be used to design lens systems to minimise certain defects in images produced by a single lens.

    "text": "The human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs. It enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us. On closing the eyes, we can identify objects to some extent by their smell, taste, sound they make or by touch. It is, however, impossible to identify colours while closing the eyes. Thus, of all the sense organs, the human eye is the most significant one as it enables us to see the beautiful, colourful world around us.\n\nThe human eye is like a camera. Its lens system forms an image on a light-sensitive screen called the retina. Light enters the eye through a thin membrane called the cornea. It forms the transparent bulge on the front surface of the eyeball as shown in Fig. 10.1. The eyeball is approximately spherical in shape with a diameter of about 2.3 cm. Most of the refraction for the light rays entering the eye occurs at the outer surface of the cornea. The crystalline lens merely provides the finer adjustment of focal length required to focus objects at different\n\ndistances on the retina. We find a structure called iris behind the cornea. Iris is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the size of the pupil. The pupil regulates and controls the amount of light entering the eye. The eye lens forms an inverted real image of the object on the retina. The retina is a delicate membrane having enormous number of light-sensitive cells. The light-sensitive cells get activated upon illumination and generate electrical signals. These signals are sent to the brain via the optic nerves. The brain interprets these signals, and finally, processes the information so that we perceive objects as they are.\n\n![](images/8ea946c66c5426cd400894304cdc3fa3ba761c37ddd57d68b50d57d023cc5cfb.jpg)  \nFigure 10.1 The human eye\n\n#### 10.1.1 Power of Accommodation",

    "text": "The eye lens is composed of a fibrous, jelly-like material. Its curvature can be modified to some extent by the ciliary muscles. The change in the curvature of the eye lens can thus change its focal length. When the muscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal length increases. This enables us to see distant objects clearly. When you are looking at objects closer to the eye, the ciliary muscles contract. This increases the curvature of the eye lens. The eye lens then becomes thicker. Consequently, the focal length of the eye lens decreases. This enables us to see nearby objects clearly.\n\nThe ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called accommodation. However, the focal length of the eye lens cannot be decreased below a certain minimum limit. Try to read a printed page by holding it very close to your eyes. You may see the image being blurred or feel strain in the eye. To see an object comfortably and distinctly, you must hold it at about $2 5 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ from the eyes. The minimum distance, at which objects can be seen most distinctly without strain, is called the least distance of distinct vision. It is also called the near point of the eye. For a young adult with normal vision, the near point is about $2 5 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ . The farthest point upto which the eye can see objects clearly is called the far point of the eye. It is infinity for a normal eye. You may note here a normal eye can see objects clearly that are between 25 cm and infinity.\n\nSometimes, the crystalline lens of people at old age becomes milky and cloudy. This condition is called cataract. This causes partial or complete loss of vision. It is possible to restore vision through a cataract surgery.",

    "text": "You must have seen and appreciated the spectacular colours in a rainbow. How could the white light of the Sun give us various colours of the rainbow? Before we take up this question, we shall first go back to the refraction of light through a prism. The inclined refracting surfaces of a glass prism show exciting phenomenon. Let us find it out through an activity.\n\n### Activity 10.2\n\nTake a thick sheet of cardboard and make a small hole or narrow slit in its middle.   \n■ Allow sunlight to fall on the narrow slit. This gives a narrow beam of white light.   \nNow, take a glass prism and allow the light from the slit to fall on one of its faces as shown in Fig. 10.5.\n\n■ Turn the prism slowly until the light that comes out of it appears on a nearby screen.   \n■ What do you observe? You will find a beautiful band of colours. Why does this happen?\n\nThe prism has probably split the incident white light into a band of colours. Note the colours that appear at the two ends of the colour band. What is the sequence of colours that you see on the screen? The various colours seen are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange and Red, as shown in Fig. 10.5. The acronym VIBGYOR will help you to remember the sequence of colours. The band of the coloured components of a light beam is called its spectrum. You might not be able to see all the colours separately. Yet something makes each colour distinct from the other. The splitting of light into its component colours is called dispersion\n\n![](images/9270d646a97fdf62e45ecac81353d3ff86bcdea3e7c7d8704dd0750369d880ec.jpg)  \nFigure 10.5 Dispersion of white light by the glass prism\n\nYou have seen that white light is dispersed into its seven-colour components by a prism. Why do we get these colours? Different colours of light bend through different angles with respect to the incident ray, as they pass through a prism. The red light bends the least while the\n\nviolet the most. Thus the rays of each colour emerge along different paths and thus become distinct. It is the band of distinct colours that we see in a spectrum.",

    "text": "Isaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain the spectrum of sunlight. He tried to split the colours of the spectrum of white light further by using another similar prism. However, he could not get any more colours. He then placed a second identical prism in an inverted position with respect to the first prism, as shown in Fig. 10.6. This allowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through the second prism. He found a beam of white light emerging from the other side of the second prism. This observation gave Newton the idea that the sunlight is made up of seven colours.\n\n![](images/4f6f8471baf95b5a3aad0e61231cdf2ce1cac468b6fa0821cd80df3b78331df4.jpg)  \nFigure 10.6 Recombination of the spectrum of white light\n\nAny light that gives a spectrum similar to that of sunlight is often referred to as white light.\n\n![](images/5ca36c0bd998cb4fe8d4b652fd8393d678bcf1c60c5a71f3545639a7c70636af.jpg)  \nFigure 10.7 Rainbow in the sky\n\nA rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky after a rain shower (Fig. 10.7). It is caused by dispersion of sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in the atmosphere. A rainbow is always formed in a direction opposite to that of the Sun. The water droplets act like small prisms. They refract and disperse the incident sunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it again when it comes out of the raindrop (Fig. 10.8). Due to the dispersion of light and internal reflection, different colours reach the observer’s eye.\n\n![](images/302430e2d54600633b1e3d57e5f75609e43d8a95d87df289e79e411e2f45ea46.jpg)  \nFigure 10.8 Rainbow formation\n\nYou can also see a rainbow on a sunny day when you look at the sky through a waterfall or through a water fountain, with the Sun behind you.",

    "text": "The twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight. The starlight, on entering the earth’s atmosphere, undergoes refraction continuously before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refraction occurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since the atmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position of the star is slightly different from its actual position. The star appears slightly higher (above) than its actual position when viewed near the horizon (Fig. 10.9). Further, this apparent position of the star is not stationary, but keeps on changing slightly, since the physical conditions of the earth’s atmosphere are not stationary, as was the case in the previous paragraph. Since the stars are very distant, they approximate point-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from the star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star fluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers – the star sometimes appears brighter, and at some other time, fainter, which is the twinkling effect.\n\n![](images/90f63b1dce11c58ad852fc803c67f09a03d4920e293208f16d6e3441d3b0b540.jpg)  \nApparent star position due to atmospheric refraction\n\nWhy don’t the planets twinkle? The planets are much closer to the earth, and are thus seen as extended sources. If we consider a planet as a collection of a large number of point-sized sources of light, the total variation in the amount of light entering our eye from all the individual point-sized sources will average out to zero, thereby nullifying the twinkling effect.",

    "text": "The interplay of light with objects around us gives rise to several spectacular phenomena in nature. The blue colour of the sky, colour of water in deep sea, the reddening of the sun at sunrise and the sunset are some of the wonderful phenomena we are familiar with. In the previous class, you have learnt about the scattering of light by colloidal particles. The path of a beam of light passing through a true solution is not visible. However, its path becomes visible through a colloidal solution where the size of the particles is relatively larger.\n\n#### 10.6.1 Tyndall Effect\n\nT h e e a r t h ’ s a t m o s p h e r e i s a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles. These particles include smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles of dust and molecules of air. When a beam of light strikes such fine particles, the path of the beam becomes visible. The light reaches us, after being reflected diffusely by these particles. The phenomenon of scattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect which you have studied in Class IX. This phenomenon is seen when a fine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole. Thus, scattering of light makes the particles visible. Tyndall effect can also be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense forest. Here, tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light.\n\nThe colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering particles. Very fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of larger size scatter light of longer wavelengths. If the size of the scattering particles is large enough, then, the scattered light may even appear white.\n\n#### 10.6.2Whyis thecolouroftheclearSkyBlue?\n\nThe molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size smaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in scattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer wavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about 1.8 times greater than blue light. Thus, when sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter wavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light\n\nenters our eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been any scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark. The sky appears dark to passengers flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not prominent at such heights.",

    "text": "We are familiar with air current and water current. We know that flowing water constitute water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric charge flows through a conductor (for example, through a metallic wire), we say that there is an electric current in the conductor. In a torch, we know that the cells (or a battery, when placed in proper order) provide flow of charges or an electric current through the torch bulb to glow. We have also seen that the torch gives light only when its switch is on. What does a switch do? A switch makes a conducting link between the cell and the bulb. A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an electric circuit. Now, if the circuit is broken anywhere (or the switch of the torch is turned of f), the current stops flowing and the bulb does not glow.\n\nHow do we express electric current? Electric current is expressed by the amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. In other words, it is the rate of flow of electric charges. In circuits using metallic wires, electrons constitute the flow of charges. However, electrons were not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first observed. So, electric current was considered to be the flow of positive charges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the direction of electric current. Conventionally, in\n\nan electric circuit the direction of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the flow of electrons, which are negative charges.\n\nIf a net charge Q, flows across any crosssection of a conductor in time t, then the current I, through the cross-section is\n\n$$\nI = \\frac {Q}{t} \\tag {11.1}\n$$",

    "text": "What makes the electric charge to flow? Let us consider the analogy of flow of water. Charges do not flow in a copper wire by themselves, just as water in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tube is connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a pressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of the other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic wire, the gravity, of course, has no role to play; the electrons move only if there is a difference of electric pressure – called the potential difference – along the conductor. This difference of potential may be produced by a battery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within a cell generates the potential difference across the\n\nterminals of the cell, even when no current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a conducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in motion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order to maintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its chemical energy stored in it.\n\nWe define the electric potential difference between two points in an electric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit charge from one point to the other –\n\nPotential difference (V) between two points $=$ Work done (W)/Charge $( \\varrho )$\n\n$$\nV = W / Q \\tag {11.2}\n$$\n\nThe SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after Alessandro Volta (1745–1827), an Italian physicist.

A straight line plot shows that as the current through a wire increases, the potential difference across the wire increases linearly – this is Ohm’s law.\n\nIn 1827, a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm (1787–1854) found out the relationship between the current I, flowing in a metallic wire and the potential difference across its terminals. The potential difference, V, across the ends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, provided its temperature remains the same. This is called Ohm’s law. In other words –\n\n$$\nV \\alpha I \\tag {11.4}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r c l} \\text {o r} & V / I & = \\quad \\text {c o n s t a n t} \\\\ & & = \\quad R \\end{array}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text {o r} \\quad V = I R \\tag {11.5}\n$$\n\nIn Eq.

Certain components offer an easy path for the flow of electric current while the others resist the flow. We know that motion of electrons in an electric circuit constitutes an electric current. The electrons, however, are not completely free to move within a conductor. They are restrained by the attraction of the atoms among which they move. Thus, motion of electrons through a conductor is retarded by its resistance. A component of a given size that offers a low resistance is a good conductor. A conductor having some appreciable resistance is called a resistor. A component of identical size that offers a higher resistance is a poor conductor.

Note the current in the ammeter.   \n■ Replace the nichrome wire by another nichrome wire of same thickness but twice the length, that is 2l [marked (2) in the Fig. 11.5].   \nNote the ammeter reading.   \n■ Now replace the wire by a thicker nichrome wire, of the same length l [marked (3)]. A thicker wire has a larger cross-sectional area. Again note down the current through the circuit.   \n■ Instead of taking a nichrome wire, connect a copper wire [marked (4) in Fig. 11.5] in the circuit. Let the wire be of the same length and same area of cross-section as that of the first nichrome wire [marked (1)]. Note the value of the current.   \n■ Notice the difference in the current in all cases.   \n■ Does the current depend on the length of the conductor?   \n■ Does the current depend on the area of cross-section of the wire used?\n\nIt is observed that the ammeter reading decreases to one-half when the length of the wire is doubled. The ammeter reading is increased when a thicker wire of the same material and of the same length is used in the circuit. A change in ammeter reading is observed when a wire of different material of the same length and the same area of crosssection is used. On applying Ohm’s law [Eqs. (11.5) – (11.7)], we observe that the resistance of the conductor depends (i) on its length, (ii) on its area of cross-section, and (iii) on the\n\nnature of its material.

Thus it is obviously impracticable to connect an electric bulb and an electric heater in series, because they need currents of widely different values to operate properly (see Example 11.3). Another major disadvantage of a series circuit is that when one component fails the circuit is broken and none of the components works. If you have used ‘fairy lights’ to decorate buildings on festivals, on marriage celebrations etc., you might have seen the electrician spending lot of time in troublelocating and replacing the ‘dead’ bulb – each has to be tested to find which has fused or gone. On the other hand, a parallel circuit divides the current through the electrical gadgets. The total resistance in a parallel circuit is decreased as per Eq. (11.18).

    "text": "We know that a battery or a cell is a source of electrical energy. The chemical reaction within the cell generates the potential difference between its two terminals that sets the electrons in motion to flow the current through a resistor or a system of resistors connected to the battery. We have also seen, in Section 11.2, that to maintain the current, the source has to keep expending its energy. Where does this energy go? A part of the source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed into useful work (like in rotating the blades of an electric fan). Rest of the source energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature of gadget. We often observe this in our everyday life. For example, an electric fan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other hand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration of resistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually gets dissipated entirely in the form of heat. This is known as the heating effect of electric current. This effect is utilised in devices such as electric heater, electric iron etc.\n\nConsider a current I flowing through a resistor of resistance $R$ . Let the potential difference across it be V (Fig. 11.13). Let $t$ be the time during which a charge $\\boldsymbol { Q }$ flows across. The work done in moving the charge $\\boldsymbol { Q }$ through a potential difference $V$ is $V Q$ . Therefore, the source must supply energy equal to $V Q$ in time t. Hence the power input to the circuit by the source is\n\n$$\nP = V \\frac {Q}{t} = V I \\tag {11.19}\n$$\n\nOr the energy supplied to the circuit by the source in time t is $P \\ \\times \\ t _ { - }$ , that is, VIt. What happens to this energy expended by the source? This energy gets dissipated in the r e s i s t o r a s h e a t . T h u s f o r a s t e a d y current I, the amount of heat $H$ produced in time t is\n\n$$\nH = V I t \\tag {11.20}\n$$\n\nApplying Ohm’s law [Eq. (11.5)], we get\n\n$$\nH = I ^ {2} R t \\tag {11.21}\n$$",

In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful electrical energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heating can increase the temperature of the components and alter their properties. However, heating effect of electric current has many useful applications. The electric laundry iron, electric toaster, electric oven, electric kettle and electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joule’s heating.\n\nThe electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric bulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is possible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such high temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as tungsten (melting point $3 3 8 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ is used for making bulb filaments. The filament should be thermally isolated as much as possible, using insulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually",

Most of the power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part of it is in the form of light radiated.\n\nAnother common application of Joule’s heating is the fuse used in electric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow of any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series with the device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of appropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper, iron, lead etc. If a current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit, the temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and breaks the circuit. The fuse wire is usually encased in a cartridge of porcelain or similar material with metal ends. The fuses used for domestic purposes are rated as 1 A, 2 A, 3 A, 5 A, 10 A, etc. For an electric iron which consumes $1 \\mathrm { k W }$ electric power when operated at 220 V, a current of (1000/220) A, that is, 4.54 A will flow in the circuit. In this case, a 5 A fuse must be used.",

    "text": "You have studied in your earlier Class that the rate of doing work is power. This is also the rate of consumption of energy.\n\nEquation (11.21) gives the rate at which electric energy is dissipated or consumed in an electric circuit. This is also termed as electric power. The power $P$ is given by\n\n$$\nP = V I\n$$\n\n$$\n\\operatorname {O r} P = I ^ {2} R = V ^ {2} / R \\tag {11.22}\n$$\n\nThe SI unit of electric power is watt (W). It is the power consumed by a device that carries 1 A of current when operated at a potential difference of 1 V. Thus,\n\n$$\n1 \\mathrm {W} = 1 \\mathrm {v o l t} \\times 1 \\text {a m p e r e} = 1 \\mathrm {V A} \\tag {11.23}\n$$\n\nThe unit ‘watt’ is very small. Therefore, in actual practice we use a much larger unit called ‘kilowatt’. It is equal to 1000 watts. Since electrical energy is the product of power and time, the unit of electric energy is, therefore, watt hour (W h). One watt hour is the energy consumed when 1 watt of power is used for 1 hour. The commercial unit of electric energy is kilowatt hour (kW h), commonly known as ‘unit’.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l} 1 \\mathrm {k W h} = 1 0 0 0 \\mathrm {w a t t} \\times 3 6 0 0 \\mathrm {s e c o n d} \\\\ = 3. 6 \\times 1 0 ^ {6} \\text {w a t t s e c o n d} \\\\ = 3. 6 \\times 1 0 ^ {6} \\text {j o u l e (J)} \\\\ \\end{array}\n$$",

To see this, now place the compass at a farther point from the conducting wire (say at point Q). What change do you observe? We see that the deflection in the needle decreases.

Suppose this straight wire is bent in the form of a circular loop and a current is passed through it. How would the magnetic field lines look like? We know that the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying straight wire depends inversely on the distance from it. Similarly at every point of a current-carrying circular loop, the concentric circles representing the magnetic field around it would become larger and larger as we move away from the wire (Fig. 12.8). By the time we reach at the centre of the circular loop, the arcs of these big circles would appear as straight lines. Every point on the wire carrying current would give rise to the magnetic field appearing as straight lines at the center of the loop. By applying the right hand rule, it is easy to check that every section of the wire contributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction within the loop.\n\n![](images/8348108c1045cd3d367c3c859e7e9d4f69bc7a74648b36371580df8c93d44795.jpg)  \nFigure 12.8\n\nMagnetic field lines of the field produced by a current-carrying circular loop\n\nWe know that the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire at a given point depends directly on the current passing through it. Therefore, if there is a circular coil having n turns, the field produced is n times as large as that produced by a single turn. This is because the current in each circular turn has the same direction, and the field due to each turn then just adds up.\n\n* This rule is also called Maxwell’s corkscrew rule. If we consider ourselves driving a corkscrew in the direction of the current, then the direction of the rotation of corkscrew is the direction of the magnetic field..",

Support for the magnet is not shown here, for simplicity.\n\n■ Take a small aluminium rod AB (of about 5 cm). Using two connecting wires suspend it horizontally from a stand, as shown in Fig. 12.12.   \n■ Place a strong horse-shoe magnet in such a way that the rod lies between the two poles with the magnetic field directed upwards. For this put the north pole of the magnet vertically below and south pole vertically above the aluminium rod (Fig. 12.12).   \n■ Connect the aluminium rod in series with a battery, a key and a rheostat.   \n■ Now pass a current through the aluminium rod from end B to end A.   \n■ What do you observe? It is observed that the rod is displaced towards the left. You will notice that the rod gets displaced.   \n■ Reverse the direction of current flowing through the rod and observe the direction of its displacement. It is now towards the right. Why does the rod get displaced?\n\nThe displacement of the rod in the above activity suggests that a force is exerted on the current-carrying aluminium rod when it is placed in a magnetic field. It also suggests that the direction of force is also reversed when the direction of current through the conductor is reversed. Now change the direction of field to vertically downwards by interchanging the two poles of the magnet. It is once again observed that the direction of force acting on the currentcarrying rod gets reversed. It shows that the direction of the force on the conductor depends upon the direction of current and the direction of the magnetic field. Experiments have shown that the displacement of the rod is largest (or the\n\nmagnitude of the force is the highest) when the direction of current is at right angles to the direction of the magnetic field. In such a condition we can use a simple rule to find the direction of the force on the conductor.",

A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the appliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur when the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. (This occurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the appliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly increases. This is called short-circuiting. The use of an electric fuse prevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage by stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating that takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit. Overloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply voltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many appliances to a single socket.\n\n## \n\n1.

The direction of the magnetic field at a point is given by the direction that a north pole placed at that point would take. Field lines are shown closer together where the magnetic field is greater.   \n■ A metallic wire carrying an electric current has associated with it a magnetic field. The field lines about the wire consist of a series of concentric circles whose direction is given by the right-hand rule.   \n■ The pattern of the magnetic field around a conductor due to an electric current flowing through it depends on the shape of the conductor. The magnetic field of a solenoid carrying a current is similar to that of a bar magnet.   \n■ An electromagnet consists of a core of soft iron wrapped around with a coil of insulated copper wire.\n\n■ A current-carrying conductor when placed in a magnetic field experiences a force. If the direction of the field and that of the current are mutually perpendicular to each other, then the force acting on the conductor will be perpendicular to both and will be given by Fleming’s left-hand rule.   \n■ In our houses we receive AC electric power of $2 2 0 \\mathrm { V }$ with a frequency of $5 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ . One of the wires in this supply is with red insulation, called live wire. The other one is of black insulation, which is a neutral wire. The potential difference between the two is $2 2 0 \\mathrm { V } .$ The third is the earth wire that has green insulation and this is connected to a metallic body deep inside earth. It is used as a safety measure to ensure that any leakage of current to a metallic body does not give any severe shock to a user.   \n■ Fuse is the most important safety device, used for protecting the circuits due to shortcircuiting or overloading of the circuits.",
