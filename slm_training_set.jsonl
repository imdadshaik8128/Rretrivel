The process of photosynthesis is very complex. Several reactions takes place in this process and intermediate compounds are also formed. Scientists had tried to formulate a simple equation to indicate photosynthesis over 200 years. The equation that is used widely is formulated and proposed by C.B. Van Neil in 1931 . His opinion was,\n\n\u201cfor each molecule of carbohydrate formed, one molecule of water and one molecule of oxygen is produced\u201d. Though photosynthesis is a very complex process, we use the following simple equation.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm {C O} _ {2} + 2 \\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} \\xrightarrow [ \\text {C h l o r o p h y l l} ]{\\text {L i g h t}} \\mathrm {C H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} + \\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} + \\mathrm {O} _ {2}\n$$\n\nWhat would be the reaction to show that glucose $\\mathrm { ( C _ { 6 } H _ { 1 2 } O _ { 6 } ) }$ is being synthesized? Write down a balanced equation to show this.\n\n(Refer the lessons Chemical equations, Carbon and its compounds in your textbook of physical science class X).\n\nVan Neil first worked on purple sulphur bacteria and found light plays a specific role in photosynthesis. Instead of $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O }$ they used $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { S }$ as a starting material. Here no oxygen is liberated during photosynthesis instead, elemental sulphur is evolved. Later he envisioned a similar process of photosynthesis in plants and proposed the above mentioned equation. Later Robert Hill showed that $\\mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ is released from water during this reaction. Then the equation was modified as follows.\n\n$$\n6 \\mathrm {C O} _ {2} + 1 2 \\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} \\xrightarrow [ \\text {C h l o r o p h y l l} ]{\\text {L i g h t}} \\mathrm {C} _ {6} \\mathrm {H} _ {1 2} \\mathrm {O} _ {6} + 6 \\mathrm {H} _ {2} \\mathrm {O} + 6 \\mathrm {O} _ {2}\n$$\n\nIt is known that plants synthesize carbohydrates, the smaller simpler ones first and from them, the more complex ones like starch and cellulose. Plants are also capable of synthesizing all other compounds like proteins, fats etc.\n\nAnimals are not capable of synthesizing carbohydrates and they have to depend on plants for the same.\n\nCan we state that photosynthesis is the basic energy source for most of the living world?

It is interesting to learn about the experiment which is one of the several milestones in the gradual development of our understanding of Photosynthesis.\n\nJoseph Priestly (1733-1804) in 1770 performed a series of experiments that revealed the essential role of air on the growth of green plants\n\n(photosynthesis was still not known to scientists at that time). You may recall, Oxygen was discovered by Priestly in 1774. The name oxygen was coined later by Lavoisier in the year 1775. Priestly observed that a candle burning in a closed bell jar, soon gets extinguished. Similarly, a mouse would soon suffocate in a closed space of the bell jar. He concluded that a burning candle or an animal, both somehow, damage air. When he placed a mint plant in the same bell jars, he found that the mouse stayed alive and the candle when lighted from outside continued burning in the presence of the mint plant. Priestly hypothesized as follows: \u2018Plants restore the air what breathing animals and burning candles remove\u2019.\n\n![](images/e5ec8aaf49de2e3fd7a5137ce67a1e965b63cdaace5bdce351056305c057788a.jpg)\n\n![](images/7d4ab83cf6c37f32454c5f68dd029108d8cfecd4c141026f9606b73e6a8388ec.jpg)\n\n![](images/9802def4ea9f9697216855819cca2658ca6a4239c0e0d4ff08edda9c890a0c5f.jpg)\n\n![](images/49330fc252409d9f7332356491c2b8e72410703c44b492a2491bfa598e84f3ba.jpg)  \nfig-3: Priestly experiment\n\nDo you find any relationship between candle, rat, mint plant ?

If energy is released when carbon dioxide and water is formed by combining oxygen with carbon and hydrogen, then what about the reverse?.

That means if plants\n\nform oxygen they have to get energy to make it possible. Where did the energy come from?\n\nA Dutch scientist, Jan Ingenhousz (1730-1799), found the answer. He studied the way in which plants form oxygen. In 1779, he noticed that it happened only in the presence of light. In an experiment with the aquatic plant, Hydrilla, he observed that in bright sunlight, small bubbles formed around the green parts while in the dark they did not form. He also found that the gas present in the bubbles was oxygen.\n\nIt was further confirmed when Engelman in the early $2 0 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century ingeniously detected the point of maximum rate of photosynthesis.

In single celled organisms, like amoeba the food may be taken in by the entire surface but as the complexity of the organism increases, different parts become specialized to perform different functions.\n\n![](images/a733e960ed5ee87e5070016bb62fc4db4aa1069af94630d81ffbeb1e9f896c14.jpg)\n\n![](images/fc462a5241665fd9bb513e1591823c71247b824cb5a1a87a1ca8ea7389780edb.jpg)\n\nFor example amoeba [fig-9(a)] takes in food using temporary finger like extensions (pseudopodia) of the cell surface which fuse over the food particle forming food vacuole. Inside the food vacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones. Then diffuse into the cytoplasm. The remaining undigested material is moved to the surface of the cell and thrown out. In Paramoecium [fig-9(b)], which is also a unicellular organism the cell has a definite shape. Food is taken in at a specific spot. Food is moved to the spot by the movement of cilia which covers the entire surface of the cell, where the food is ingested (cytostome).", "response": "In Chapter 1 - Nutrition - Food supplying system > How do organisms obtain their nutrition, the text discusses: Depending on the type and availability of food organisms can assort to a range of strategies of food intake and use.

The genus contains about 170 twining species that are widely distributed throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the world.\n\nThe dodder plant contains no chlorophyll. Cuscuta reflexa\n\nhas been found to have very little amount of chlorophyll and instead absorbs food through haustoria. They are root like structures that penetrate the tissue of a host plant and may kill it. The slender, string like stems of the dodder may be yellow, orange, pink, or brown in colour. It\u2019s leaves are reduced to minute scales. The dodder\u2019s flowers, in nodule like clusters, are made up of tiny yellow or white bell-like petals.\n\nThe dodder\u2019s seed germinates, forming an anchoring root, and then sends up a slender stem that grows in a spiral fashion until it reaches a host plant. It then twines around the stem of the host plant and forms haustoria, which penetrate through it. Water is drawn through the haustoria from the host plant\u2019s xylem, and nutrients are drawn from its phloem. Meanwhile, the root rots away after contact has been made with a host stem. As the dodder grows, it sends out new haustoria (parasitic roots) and establishes itself very firmly on the host plant. After growing in a few spirals around one host shoot, the dodder finds its way to another, and it continues to twine and branch until it resembles a fine, densely tangled web of thin stems enveloping the host plant.

Saliva mainly contains an enzyme amylase (ptyalin) which helps in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates to simple ones.

How?\n\nLavoisier also carried out several experiments to understand the property of gases. In his early experiments, it is clear that Lavoisier thought that the gas liberated on heating powdered charcoal in a belljar kept over water in a trough was like fixed air. In those days carbon dioxide was known as fixed air. The next series of experiments dealt with the combustion of phosphorus in a belljar. From these studies Lavoisier showed that whatever in the atmospheric air which combined with the phosphorus, was not water vapour. His final words are that the substance which combines with the phosphorus is \u201ceither air itself, or another elastic fluid present, in a certain proportion, in the air which we breathe\u201d. This was the respirable air, a component of air that also helped in burning.\n\nWhat was produced by combustion according to Lavoisier?\n\nWhat did Lavoisier find out about air from his experiments?\n\nWhat conclusion can be drawn from Lavoisier\u2019s experiments?\n\nLavoisier noted that there was a profound difference between the air in which combustion of a metal had been carried out and the one which had served for respiration. The air that we breathe out precipitated lime water while that after heating metal did not.\n\nFrom this he deduced that there were two processes involved in respiration, and that of these he probably knew only one. Therefore, he carried out another experiment by which he showed that about one sixth of the volume of \u2018vitiated air\u2019(a term used then to show air from which the component needed for burning had been removed) consists of chalky acid gas (fixed air). Therefore, to recreate common air from vitiated air, it was not enough merely to add the appropriate amount of air needed for burning or respirable air; the existing chalky acid gas must also be removed.", "response": "In Chapter 2 - Respiration-The energy producing system > Discovery of gases and respiration, the text discusses: The term respiration came into use, a century after the word breathing was used, way back in the $1 4 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century.

The organs involved are mainly the lungs. You can\u2019t see your lungs, but it\u2019s easy to feel them in action. Put your hands on your chest and breathe in very deeply. You will feel your chest getting slightly bigger. Now breathe out the air, and feel your chest return to its regular size. You\u2019ve just felt the power of your lungs! The lungs themselves can neither draw in air nor push it out. Instead, the chest wall muscles and another flexible\n\nflattened muscle called diaphragm helps the lungs in moving air into and out of them. See how the diaphragm works in the figure.\n\nWhat is the role of diaphragm and ribs in respiration? Are both active in men and women?\n\nThe chest wall is made up of ribs, muscles, and the skin. The ribs are attached at an angle to the spine (if you run your finger along one of your ribs, you will notice that it extends downward from the spine). When we inhale, the chest wall moves up and expands. This causes an increase in the volume of the chest cavity.\n\nThe diaphragm may be imagined as the \u2018floor\u2019 if you think of the chest cavity as a \u201croom.\u201d When the diaphragm is relaxed when we breath out, it is in the shape of a dome with the convex side of the dome extending into the chest cavity. When the diaphragm contracts during inhalation it flattens out a bit or the dome moves downward. As a result, the volume of the chest cavity is increased.\n\nWhen the diaphragm flattens and the volume of the chest cavity is increased, its internal pressure decreases and the air from the outside rushes into the lungs. This is inspiration (inhalation).\n\nThen the reverse occurs. The chest wall is lowered and moves inward, and the diaphragm relaxes and assumes its dome shape. These changes increase the pressure on the lungs; their elastic tissue contracts and squeezes the air out through the nose to the external atmosphere. This is expiration (exhalation).\n\n![](images/77f331616297c52f913d71f014f15c0eaec91d0db20018d3a1886bd6a2ee4430.jpg)", "response": "In Chapter 2 - Respiration-The energy producing system > Mechanism of respiration in human beings, the text discusses: ![](images/6f688d7490d279bc4557aeff69490242bb09a913f4a680c5b287feada2438cd4.jpg)  \nfig-7: Movement of rib cage during inhalation, exhalation\n\nfig-6: D..."}

Thus cellular respiration is the essential processes of life. So living cells must carry out cellular respiration.

The substances become sour because of ethyl alchohol or lactic acid is produced in this process. In Animals the anaerobic respiration leads to formation of lactic acid from glucose. In anaerobic repiration few ATP molecules are produced. Cellular respiration in prokaryotic cells like that of bacteria occurs within the cytoplasm. In eukaryotic cells cytoplasm and mitochondria are the sites of the reactions. The produced energy is stored in mitochondria in the form of ATP. That is why mitochondria are called \u201cpower houses of the cell\u201d.\n\nThe exact chemical details of the breakdown of sugar or other foods within a living cell does not take place as a single reaction, but occurs in a series of small steps.\n\nHow does this affect the energy release?

But you do not start a race by standing on the track and panting for a few minutes to stoke up with oxygen first. In fact you can run the race with very little extra breathing. The fastest sprinters do not breathe at all when running a hundred yards. After you have reached the destiny, however, you feel very different. Depending on your state of training, and on how hard you ran, you will pant for some minutes after the race, until your breathing gradually returns to normal.\n\nThese facts could be linked up with what we have learned so far about ATP. It might be that the race was run on the energy\n\nproduced when the ATP already present in your muscles was being converted to ADP. Unfortunately this pleasantly simple idea is inadequate, because we only carry sufficient ATP in a muscle to last for about half a second when doing vigorous exercise. There must be some other explanation for the way in which we can produce energy first and then use up oxygen later.\n\nOne approach in the study of this problem was to analyze the blood of a person during and after exercise. For obvious reasons the athlete taking part in the experiment had to stay still where the apparatus was. He pedaled a stationary bicycle, or ran on a tread mill (belt moving as fast backwards as the athlete moved forwards). Some results are shown in the graph.

What is surprising is that the athlete needs a great length of time to recover. The simplest explanation we can produce at-this stage is that the sugar in the working muscles was being changed to lactic acid. The energy stored in lactic acid molecules is less than that in sugar molecules, and if the acid comes from the sugar then the energy released could be used to rebuild ATP from ADP and phosphate.\n\nDuring a 100 m race a well-trained athlete can hold his breath all the time it is not until afterwards that he pants. In this case, the muscles are using the energy released during the anaerobic breakdown of glucose. It is not until afterwards that the athlete obtains the oxygen needed in order to remove the lactic acid.

The same type of smell you can notice from preserved idly, dosa dough at your home. But not in refrigirator. The ethanol can be separated from the yeast-glucose mixture by the process of fractional distillation since ethanol boils at a lower temperature $( 7 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ than the sugar solution.

We know that we feel hot after some form of strenuous exercise such as running.\n\nDuring cellular respiration energy is released. Some part of energy is stored in the form of ATP. Some part of energy is utilised in our day to day life activities. And the excess amount of energy is released in the form of heat. But in case of vigorous activity like running we need more amount of energy. For this the rate of respiration is increased. So heat is also released in excess quantity. That\u2019s why we feel warm. If the oxygen is not sufficient during vigorous exersise muscles start anaerobic respiration. Hence, lactic acid is formed. We know that accumulation of lactic acid causes pain in muscle.

Animals either terrestrial or aquatic adopted to different types of respiration and possess different types of respiratory organs mostly depending on the habitat in which they live. Body size, availability of water and the type of\n\ntheir circulatory system are some of the reasons for the animals to develop different types of respiratory organs.\n\nThere is tracheal respiratory system in insects like cockroach, grasshopper etc. Tracheal respiratory system consists of series of tubes called trachea. This is divided into fine branches called tracheoles which carry air directly to the cells in the tissues.\n\nSome aquatic animals like fishes have developed special organs for respiration which are known as gills or branchiae. Blood supplied to gills through capillaries which have thin walls where gases are exchanged. This is called branchial respiration. Fish keeps its mouth open and lowers the floor of the oral cavity. As a result water from outside will be drawn into the oral cavity. Now the mouth is closed and the floor of the oral cavity is raised. Water is pushed into the pharynx and is forced to gill pouches through internal branchial apertures. Gill lamellae are bathed with water and gaseous exchange takes place.\n\nRespiration through skin is called cutaneous respiration.

In 1574, an Italian doctor, Girolamo Fabrici, was studying the veins in the leg. He noticed that they had small valves in them. If the blood moved in one direction, the valves folded towards the walls of the vessel, so that the blood could pass without trouble. If the blood moved in the opposite direction, the valves closed.\n\nThis meant they are one-way valves. The valves permitted the blood to move even when a person is standing upright. But not move downward.\n\nWhen a person moves his legs, or just tightens his leg muscles, those muscles squeeze the veins and force the blood in those veins to move upward against the pull of gravity (because that\u2019s the only way to go). If a person keeps his leg muscles relaxed, the blood isn\u2019t moving much, but at least it isn\u2019t being pulled down by gravity. The valves won\u2019t allow that.\n\nEveryone thought that the blood leaving the left ventricle always movedT away from the heart for which Fabrici paid no attention. He missed the importance of his own discovery. But then, William Harvey (1578-1657), an Englishman who, after he became a doctor, went to Italy for further education and studied under Fabrici.\n\n![](images/4cf174cb9ec54cb7b4612390dbf90cc19eb3d2aa64107e9a944bda5f8643fd97.jpg)  \nfig-6: William Harvey\n\nHarvey dissected the hearts of dead people and studied the valves between each atrium and its ventricle. He noticed that they were oneway valves. They allowed the blood to flow from the atrium to the ventricle without any hinderance.\n\nWhen the heart contracted, however, no blood in the ventricle could flow back into the atrium. Instead, all the blood was pushed out into the arteries.\n\nHarvey began thinking about the valves his teacher, Fabrici, had discovered in the leg veins. They were one-way, and they forced the blood to move toward the heart.\n\nHe checked that by tying off and blocking different veins in animals he experimented on the veins always bulged on the side of the block away from the heart.

It is known as systemic circulation. As the blood reaches the heart two times, once through pulmonary cycle and again through systemic cycle, it is called double circulation.\n\nHarvey also showed that it was impossible, suppose that the blood was used up in the body and that new blood was formed. He measured how much blood the heart pumped in one contraction and also counted the number of contractions.\n\nHe found that in one hour, the heart pumped out a quantity of blood that was three times the weight of a man. The body couldn\u2019t use up blood and form new blood at such a rate. The same blood had to circulate and be used over and over again.T\n\nHarvey still had some problem.

If it stops beating, it results in the death of a person.\n\nOne contraction and one relaxation of atria and ventricles is called one cardiac cycle.\n\n1. We start with the imagination that all the four chambers of the heart are in relaxed state (diastole).   \n2. Blood from venacava and pulmonary veins enters the right and left atria respectively.   \n3. Now the atria contract, forcing the blood to enter into the ventricles.   \n4. When the ventricles are filled with blood they start contracting and atria start relaxing. The aperture between the atria and ventricles is closed by valves. On ventricular contraction due to pressure the blood moves into the aorta and pulmonary artery. When the valves are closed forcibly, we can listen to the first sharp sound of the heart lub.   \n5. When the ventricles start relaxing the pressure in the ventricles is reduced. The blood which has entered the arteries tries to come back into the ventricles. The valves which are present in the blood vessels are closed to prevent backward flow of blood into the ventricles. Now we can listen to a dull sound of the heart dub. The atria are filled up with blood and are ready to pump the blood into the ventricles.\n\nThe sequential events in the heart which are cyclically repeated are called cardiac cycle. The cardiac cycle includes an active phase systole and a resting phase the diastole of atria and ventricles.\n\nThe time needed for atrial contraction (atrial systole) is 0.11- 0.14 seconds. The time needed for ventricular contraction (ventricular systole) is 0.27-0.35 seconds. The time needed for relaxation of both auricles and ventriculars i.e. joint diastole is about 0.4 seconds. The whole process is completed in approximately 0.8 seconds.\n\nHence, naturally the blood is pumped into the blood vessels at regular intervals. The tissues will not receive the blood continuously, but in the form of spurts. When we keep our finger at the wrist, where the artery is passing into the hand we feel the pressure of blood moving in it. This is the pulse.

Observe the mass of fine threads coming from the seed by hand lens. These are roots. They have fine microscopic structures called root hairs. These are root hairs through which water enters the plant. Gently squash a portion of the root hair between slide and cover slip in a drop of water and examine under a microscope. Note the thinness of the walls of root hairs. It is not completely understood how the water enters the root hairs and passes inwards from cell to cell until it gets into the xylem vessels,\n\nbut there is no doubt that osmosis plays an important role.(IX class plasmamembrane)\n\nEvery living cell acts as an osmotic system, the cytoplasm lining of the cell wall acts as the semipermeable membrane. Observe the following figure, notice how do roots penetrate into soil? You will find that the root hairs grow out into the spaces between the soil particles and that the hairs are surrounded by moisture.\n\n![](images/8457e28a2a6a9d3bfcd63084914d4c7be30ba31a8ef6c975d69173fe3617d300.jpg)  \nfig-16: L.S of root showing relationship of root hair and soil water\n\nNote: In fig-16 Arrow marks shows the direction of flow of water.\n\nThe soil water is an extremely dilute solution of salts. Soil water concentration is more dilute than that of the cell sap in the root hair; therefore water will pass into the vacuole of the root hair by osmosis. Recall the process of osmosis that you have learnt in the chapter \u201cmoving of substances through plasma membrane\u201d in class IX. The entry of water dilutes the contents of the root hair vacuole so that it becomes more dilute than it\u2019s neighbouring cell.\n\nSo, water passes into the neighbouring cell which in turn becomes diluted, finally water enters the xylem vessels. As there are vast number of root hairs and root cells involved, a pressure in the xylem vessels develops which forces the water upwards. This total pressure is known as root pressure. Root pressure is not the main cause of movement of water in xylem but it is certainly one of the factor. The other factors are also there.

Water evaporates through stomata of leaves and lenticels of stem.\n\nWhen the leaves transpire, there is a pulling effect on the continuous columns of water in the xylem vessels. The top ends of these vessels are surrounded by the leaf\u2019s mesophyll cells which contain cell sap, so the water is continuous from the xylem vessels to the walls of the mesophyll cells from which it evaporates into the air spaces causing the pull. The water column does not break because of its continuous molecular attraction. This is a property of water you demonstrate every time you drink through a straw.\n\nNow we have a picture of the water-conducting system of a tree. Water is absorbed by osmosis from the soil by\n\nthe root hairs. This is passed into the xylem vessels which form a continuous system of tubes through root and stem into the leaves. Here the water evaporates and releases into the atmosphere. The evaporation creates the main pull of water above root pressure which gives a variable and minor push from below. This results in a continuous column of moving water, the \u2018transpiration stream\u2019.\n\nIs there any relation between transpiration and rain fall?\n\nThe amount of water passing through a plant is often considerable. For example, an oak tree can transpire as much as 900 liters of water per day. It follows therefore that areas of forest significantly affect the degree of saturation of the air above them, so that when air currents bring air which is already nearly saturated to a forest area, it becomes fully saturated and comes down as rain; this is why forest areas often have a higher rainfall than areas nearby.", "response": "In Chapter 3 - Transportation - The circulatory system > The mechanism of water movement in plants, the text discusses: We have seen that there is a push from below due to root pressure on the columns of water in the xylem vessels, but this is seldom high and in some se..."}

The following experiments provide evidence that food is transported in the phloem cells.\n\nPhloem sieve tubes are extremely small and theN analysis of their contents is not easy. Biologists studied about food transportation in plants with the help of aphids (greenfly). When you see aphids clustering round the young stems of plants as they feed on the plant juices. To obtain this juice an aphidG pierces the plant tissues with its long needle like organ \u201cproboscis\u201d. It can be shown when a feeding aphid is killed and the stem carefully sectioned, the proboscisN only penetrates upto a phloem sieve tube. This\n\nproboscis also provides a ready-made means of obtaining the juice for analysis! The experiment can be done in this way. An aphid is killed while in the act of feeding and the body is then carefully cut away, leaving the hollow proboscis still inserted into the phloem. It is found that because the contents of the phloem sieve tubes are under slight pressure the fluid slowly exudes from the cut end of the proboscis in the form of drops; these drops are then collected and analysed. The fluid is found to contain sugars and amino acids.T\n\nNot surprisingly, aphids absorb so much sugar from the phloem that they cannot assimilate all of it and it excretes out of the body as a sticky syrup called honey dew. Leaves which have been attacked by aphids oftenT feel sticky as a result of honey dew.\n\n![](images/1bd7678f48aef266f74b23347f8277cbdd5c156543f300ece1e6409017fac33d.jpg)  \nfig-20: Removing ring of bark (Ringing experiment)\n\nYou may notice that sometimes barks of the tree damaged more than a half, even then the tree is alive.

In fact, whenever we move the three basic functions, such as movement, balance and coordination work together to perform purposeful motions of body parts. This is actually quite a feat, because moving is a complex process for the body.\n\nEven standing upright is a difficult challenge of balancing on just two feet with a narrow base. Yet, it is common for us not only to stand upright easily and apparently, effortlessly, but also while keeping our balance to perform many other functions.\n\nWhat other functions do you think needed in coordination and balance?\n\nAll our functions are carried out by an effort of several systems working together. For example, while movement, we hardly ever use just the skeletal system or muscular system alone, several other systems also have their own roles to play. Even within the muscular system, several muscles work in a sequence or at once.\n\nWhat triggers movement of the muscles?\n\nAll our body organs, tissues and cells work together systematically. All of them pick up signals of change from their surroundings and respond to them. This process triggers different functions in our body as well as by our body.

They are known Islets of Langerhans (Islets stands for islands), but their function remained unknown. Many others interested in the function of pancreas and found that its removal from the body of an experimental animal would lead to the development of diseases similar to a well-known human ailment \u2018sugar diabetes\u2019. This is a condition in which the amount of free sugar in the blood and in the urine is abnormally high. It\u2019s a cause in man was unknown but evidence pointed to the pancreas as a possible role.\n\n![](images/d51a18743a4ff864387501a878dabf832cf273760e28e1f66fad6e8c9287313f.jpg)  \nfig-15: Pancreas\n\n![](images/0cbc0257882bdb78c9885dbda16fce01b2ddf4fc5b69dfc540962190f301b878.jpg)  \nfig-16: Paul Langerhans\n\nThe next stage was reached when it was found that tying up the pancreatic duct that emerged from the duodenum( a part of the small intestine) would cause the pancreas to degenerate but the Islets of Langerhans would remain normal. Moreover, an animal so treated would not develop diabetes. This was really a strong evidence that the level of blood sugar is linked with the islet cells. By 1912, workers were convinced that the islets produced a secretion which directly liberated into the blood. In Latin \u2018insula\u2019 means an island. The name insulin was coined for the secretion, even though it had not been isolated.\n\nTen years later in Toronto, Banting, Best, and Macleod finally succeeded in extracting insulin from degenerate animal pancrease whose ducts to the intestine had been tied. When given by intravenous injection to a dog with no pancreas, this substance kept it alive and healthy with a low level of blood sugar. Insulin is now produced in large quantities for the treatment of human sufferers from sugar diabetes, to whom it is administered by injection into the skin.\n\nInsulin thus is a chemical that acts as it reaches blood from the cells that produce it.", "response": "In Chapter 5 - Coordination - The linking system > The Story of insulin, the text discusses: In 1868 Paul Langerhans, Professor of Pathology at the University of Freiburg in Germany, working on the structure of the pancreas, noted certain patc..."}

In 1905 the English physiologist Starling had coined the term hormone (Greek, hormao \u2013 to impel) for such secretions. The glands secreting hormones were termed ductless glands, since they have no tube or duct to carry away their products, which pass straight into the blood. In this way they differ from glands such as the liver and pancreas, whose secretions pass down ducts which are connected to other organs.\n\nThe human body contains many other ductless glands (endocrine glands).Glands do not produce their hormones at a steady rate. The adrenal gland, for example, normally has a low output.\n\n![](images/e462a4d09a31f451aa7c0ca29fa44ed5304295b1b6f4c2922ec746a52251183e.jpg)  \nfig-17: Cock fight\n\nWhat will you do if a dog is after you?

The first thing we do is running away from the place.\n\nTry to note the body language of humans / animals when they are fighting / scared.\n\nIf we observe our body, when we are afraid, the rate of heart beat increases; the breath rate will be\n\nfaster; blood pressure increases; the hair on the body becomes erect and we get goose bumps. The other things we might not observe are pupil dilation, skin becomes more sensitive, and rarely the bladder and the rectum may be emptied. We come to normal state only after we reach a safe spot.\n\nWe have already studied about nerve co-ordination, where nerves carry stimuli from sense organs to central nervous system and orders to effectors organs-the muscles. But, in the above situation the action of the nervous system is limited. All the changes in the body are carried out under the influence of a chemical called \u2018Adrenalin\u2019 hormone, released by Adrenal gland which is an endocrine gland. The various actions of the body are controlled by hormones and co-ordinated by nervous system. So in this type of conditions nervous system and endocrine system work together to bring about control and co-ordination.\n\nAsk your teacher why Adrenalin hormone is also called fight or flight hormone.\n\nThe whole system of ductless glands is called the endocrine system.

You know that increased levels of adrenalin are responsible for anxiety. When the levels of adrenalin in the blood come down slowly we come to normal state. If the adrenalin levels persist for a longer period of time, regular metabolic activities are disturbed.\n\nIncrease in adrenalin levels leads to anger, decrease in adrenalin levels leads to normal position.\n\nWhat will happen if it is continued for longer periods of time?\n\nSimilarly the sugar levels in the blood rise than normal level, they are detected by the cells of pancreas, which respond by producing more insulin into the blood.

They are called pulvini. Here cells contain lot of water and large intercellular spaces. Due to water pressure pulvini hold the leaf erect. Touch me not plant shows nastic movement by touch. This is called thigmonasty. When we touch the leaves, an electrical impulse is generated. This impulse acts on plant hormone. Because of this hormone water in the pulvini cells which are closer to the leaf vein migrate to other side of the cells.Then pulvini loss its firmness hence leaves become fold. After 20 to 30 minutes water comes back pulvini attains firmness and leaves become erect.\n\nYou might have observed the tendrils of plants growing towards a support. Can you imagine how is it happening? Would you think it is responding to a stimulus?\n\nBoth plants and animals react to various stimuli around them. But the method of responding to stimuli is not similar in plants and animals. Higher animals respond to stimuli because they have a nervous system and an endocrine system. Plants do not have a well-defined nervous or endocrine system. They do have some mechanism of control by means of some chemicals or hormones.\n\nPlants can sense the presence of stimuli like light, heat, water, touch, pressure, chemicals, gravity etc. The hormones present in the plants called phytohormones (phyto means plant) control responses towards the stimuli mentioned above. Phytohormones coordinate the activities of the plant usually by controlling one or the other aspect of the growth of the plant. So plant hormones are also called growth substances.

Take transverse sections of both stems, observe them under microscope.\n\nDo you find any difference in the shape of epidermal cells?\n\nCharles Darwin and his son Francis Darwin performed some experiments on phototropism. They covered the terminal portion of the tip of stem(coleoptile) with a cylinder of metal foil. Exposed the plant to light coming from the side. The characteristic bending of the seedling did not occur. When, light was permitted to penetrate the cylinder bending occurred normally. They stated that when seedlings are freely exposed to a lateral light some \u2018influence\u2019 is transmitted from upper to the lower part causing the material to bend.\n\nIn 1926, the Dutch plant physiologist F.W. Went succeeded in separating this \u2018influence\u2019 from the plant fig-20: Elong that produced it. Went cut off coleoptile tips from oat seedlings.

They were kept in the dark during the entire experiment.

This type of response is called nastic movement.\n\nLet us observe the growth of a creeper plant near window. The shoots of creeper bend towards sunlight. Such type of response of a plant to light is called photo tropism (photo means light, tropism means movement).\n\nWe know that roots always grow downwards.

But in creepers like cucumber, bitter gourd, the stem is weak and thin. Hence plant cannot grow erect. Tendrils play a vital role to make the plant erect.

Depending upon the species of plant involved, an ovary may have one, two, several, or even hundreds of ovules. At the center of each ovule there is $\\mathrm { a }$ a microscopic embryo sac filled with food and water. The embryo sac is composed of gametophyte cells.\n\nThe majority of flowering plants have an embryo sac consisting of seven cells and eight nuclei. At first female gametocyte undergoes series of 3 mitotic cell divisions to form eight nucleate stage of embryosac. Among these one large central cell\n\n![](images/ab4ab63766445d1f101583ab8c0188b1dee9239509bb3d9d518d40f3b6413357.jpg)  \nfig-19: Pollen grain\n\n![](images/9f21c4ea25cca6e6b8d1ddc09727e73ac3d9198eded1e59360bda6b7f53fb314.jpg)  \nfig-20: Structure of gynoecium\n\ncontains two nuclei, called polar nuclei. Three cells move towards top end and are called antipodals. Three cells are grouped at micropylar end (place where pollen tube enters) of which two cells of this are called synergids and central one is egg cell. Cells on the surface of the stigma secretes a sticky nutrient fluid contains sugars and other substances. This will help the pollengrain to germinate. Then it forms pollen tube. It bears two nuclei. Soon after the tip of the pollen tube enters the embryo sac, the end of the tube ruptures and releases the two nuclei into the embryo sac.\n\nOne of the two nuclei fuses with the egg to form a zygote. It is called fertilization. By the time the egg cell has been fertilized, the two polar nuclei combine to form a single fusion nucleus. Now the second male\n\nnucleus deposited in the embryo sac by the pollen tube moves to the center and unites with the fusion nucleus. The zygote will develop into an embryonic plant within the ovule. Union of the fusion nucleus with the second male nucleus stimulates the formation of a new tissue the endosperm. In which, food materials are stored as development of the ovule proceeds.\n\n![](images/a5b3c79788fed220fb3e105b1f12374c8174dff9f949723845ee19f1ea5c2438.jpg)  \nfig-21: Fertilisation\n\nUnion of one nucleus with the egg, and the second nucleus with the fusion nucleus is called double fertilization. As far as we know, double fertilization occurs only in flowering plants. After double fertilization, the ovule increases in size rapidly as a result of the formation of endosperm tissue by mitosis and the development of the new embryo. The embryo consists of one or more cotyledons.R\n\nThe cotyledons develops by utilizing the food stored in endosperm. The cotyledons of some flowering plants, beans for example, digest, absorb, and store the foods from the endosperm as the ovule is maturing into a seed. As a consequence, the cotyledons become greatly enlarged because of stored food and the endosperm disappears more or less completely. Many other flowering plants (such as corn or castor), the endosperm tissue continues to grow as the ovule matures into a seed.", "response": "In Chapter 6 - Reproduction - The generating system > Structure of the ovule, the text discusses: An ovule is an egg-shaped structure attached by a stalk to the inner side of the ovary.

This was one of the first attempts to understand the mechanism of cell division. He stated that binary fission of cells was the means of reproduction of animal cells. What happens during cell division could only be understood better when scientists came to know what is present inside the nucleus of the cell.\n\nIn 1879 Walther Flemming (1843\u20131905) examined many kinds of animal and plant cells and selected those that showed division. He reported from his observations of such cells that there were\n\nstring like structures in the nucleus which split longitudinally during cell division. He named such a process of division as mitosis (mitos- means fine threads) as the dividing structures resembled threads. He made a meticulous observation and made sketches and observed that there were a sequence of events in the process of division. A decade later these thread like structures were named as chromosomes (coloured bodies) as repeatedly in efforts to see them scientists were trying to use dyes to stain the nucleus and found that these structures were stained most often. His most important discovery was chromosomes appear double in nature.\n\nWilhelm Roux (1850-1924) proposed that chromosomes carried a different set of heritable elements and longitudinal splitting observed by Flemming, ensured the equal division of these elements. Combined with the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel\u2019s 1866 paper on heritable elements in peas, these results highlighted the central role of the chromosomes in carrying heritable material (or genetic material). In cell division the cell divides into two halves with equal number of chromosomes which are similar to parent cell and are diploid in nature.\n\nBut the chromosomes number always remained the same. Biologists\n\nalso began to wonder about this. When cells divide, the daughter always have the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Let us assume that cell division is always preceded by mitosis. In case of man egg cells and sperm cells like other cells, must contain 46 chromosomes. But if\n\nthis were so, then the union of egg nucleus and sperm nucleus , which takes place during fertilization would produce a total of 92 chromosomes in zygote. If it continues this would be 184, 368 and so on. But the situation is not like that.\n\nAugust Weismann (1834-1914) a biologist hypothesised that\n\n1. In successive generations, individuals of the same species have the same number of chromosomes.   \n2. In successive cell division the number of chromosomes always remain constant.\n\n![](images/e838839800ce6b100b0bb7c4cb4b26995d442a91759935aebdb9ca529e22d017.jpg)  \nfig-26: August Weismann", "response": "In Chapter 6 - Reproduction - The generating system > Cell division and continuation of life, the text discusses: Continuation of life starts from cells either those of the general body or the sex cells (gametes).\n\nVirchow (1821\u20131902) a proponent of cell theory is..."}

The process of cell divisoin is same in unicellular organisms and highly evolved multicellular organisms like human being.\n\nCell division is the process that transforms a human fertilized egg into a baby in nine months and into an adult in the next 20 years. Cell division and function in a multicellular organism is highly regulated. It occurs only when there is a need for it.\n\nCells in some organs, such as heart and brain of an individual never divide. On the other hand bone marrow cells actively divide to produce red blood cells, which have a short life span 120 days in the body. For example, if you cut your finger and bleed, soon a blood clot forms to stop the bleeding. This brings in various chemicals to the site that stimulate skin cells to divide and heal the wound. Cell division ceases as the wound is completely healed. In contrast, cancer cells do not respond to such growth regulating factors and continuously divide at the expense of normal cells, thus ultimately killing the host. So it becomes important to understand the processes involved in cell division. The cell cycle will help us understand this better.\n\n![](images/82acf08e0d5d096292f118baeff089706232ef9265959dbc2e6fce1156b5408d.jpg)  \nfig-28: Interphase", "response": "In Chapter 6 - Reproduction - The generating system > Cell division in Human beings, the text discusses: We know that cell as the structural and functional units of life of any organism.

Levels of different substances are generally maintained in the blood mainly by our digestive system. One of the major substances is glucose. When its levels in the blood fall, we get hunger pangs in stomach. This again involves production of a series of proteins, some of which are hormones like Ghrelin. Secretion of the hormone \u201cGhrelin\u201d starts in the stomach when it goes empty. Ghrelin is secreted from certain cells in the wall of the stomach. Hunger contractions (hunger pangs) start to occur in the stomach due to hunger generating signals that reach the brain from the stomach due to the secretion of this hormone. It is believed that the Diencephalon in fore brain and vagus nerve (( $1 0 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ cranial nerve) plays an important role in carrying these signals to the brain. Hunger pangs continue up to 30- 45 minutes. Increase in ghrelin levels results in sensation of hunger and motivation to consume food.\n\nWhich nervous system controlls the hunger pangs.\n\nWhat kinds of controls are exercised during sensation of hunger?

Mucus lubricates and protects the oesophageal walls from damage. This helps the food bolus to slide down easily just as the oiled potatoes that move in the tube. Besides this, the saliva in the bolus also aids in easy movement of food, which moves into the stomach.\n\nThe wall of the oesophagus is made up of two kinds of smooth muscles.

As a consequence, the intestine has developed a rich store of co ordinated movements of its muscular apparatus along with neural apparatus to ensure the appropriate mixing and propulsion of contents during digestion, absorption, and excretion.\n\nThe neural apparatus of our digestive tract comprises of such a vast and complicated network of neurons that it has been nicknamed by scientists as the second brain!\n\nResearch in this area is currently investigating how the second brain mediates the body\u2019s immune response; after all, at least 70 percent of our immune system is aimed at the gut to expel and kill foreign invaders.\n\nScientists are also working to find out how trillions of bacteria in the gut \u2018communicate\u2019 with the cells of gut nervous system.\n\nA deeper understanding of this mass of neural tissue, filled with important neurotransmitters, is revealing that it does much more than merely handle digestion or inflict the occasional nervous pang of hunger.

Technically known as the enteric nervous system, the second brain consists of sheaths of neurons embedded in the walls of the long tube of our gut, or alimentary canal, which measures about nine meters end to end from the oesophagus to the anus. The second brain contains some 100 million neurons, more than in either the spinal cord or the peripheral nervous system. This multitude of neurons in the enteric nervous system enables us to \u201cfeel\u201d the inner world of our gut and its contents. Stimulating and coordinating the breaking down of food, absorbing nutrients, and expelling of waste requires chemical processing, mechanical mixing and rhythmic muscle contractions that move everything down the line.\n\nThus equipped with its own reflexes and senses, the second brain can control several gut functions often independently of the brain. Several scientists also believe that the system is a way too complicated to have evolved only to make sure things move through and out of our gut smoothly.\n\n![](images/5e077724e2f1dcca54e17d5f1a7192bcddc0fc56154b17aca7ec5da97673b039.jpg)\n\nWhat moves out of the gut?\n\nTwo major pathways of waste expulsion are shown above.

You find the tissue paper had absorbed the water from the tea leaves.\n\nSimilarly when the unwanted waste material (stools / faeces) reach the large intestine. The peristaltic waves move the stool into the rectum. The left side of the colon acts like a storage tank of faeces. Water gets reabsorbed and the remaining wastes usually hard mass gets stored in the last part (Rectum) of the large intestine.

Mendel did the experiment with two pure breeds of peas for seed colour contrasting characters yellow and green, and they are represented as yellow with \u2018Y\u2019 and green with \u2018y\u2019. He started cross fertilizing pure breeds having contrasting characters.\n\nMendel started with two pure breeds of peas with different properties. We here take as an example a characteristic colour of the pea seeds yellow and green.\n\n![](images/371de881c05bef58367d8a24dd5a4705a1d9a606531c4baf1aecb389df6d2524.jpg)\n\n1.

Rest of the yellow seed giving pea plants gave about $50 \\%$ yellow and about $2 5 \\%$ green seed giving pea plants.   \n. $2 5 \\%$ pea plants gave only green seed giving pea plants.\n\nMendel made some assumptions by which he could explain his observations.\n\nAssumption 1: Every pea plant has two \u2018factors\u2019 which are responsible for producing a particular character or trait. The determining agent responsible for each trait is called a factor.\n\nMendel carefully choose the plants which did not produce a mixed result (pure). In our example of yellow and green peas, a pure breed (parental stage) will have both the \u2018factors\u2019 of the same type.\n\nA pure breed (parental) yellow seed giving pea will have both the \u2018factors\u2019 of the same type. Let us denote them by \u2018YY\u2019.\n\nA pure breed (parental) green seed giving pea will have both the \u2018factors\u2019 of the same type. Let us denote them by \u2018yy\u2019.\n\nAssumption-2 : During reproduction one \u2018factor\u2019 from each parent is taken to form a new pair in the progeny.\n\nAssumption-3 : One of these will always dominate the other if mixed together. The trait expressed in F1 generation is called dominant. While the other which did not express in F1 is called recessive.\n\nAssume that \u2018Y\u2019 (the one causing yellow colour) is a dominating \u2018factor\u2019. That means if \u2018Y\u2019 and \u2018y\u2019 come together \u2018Y\u2019 will dominate. Then the pea seeds will be always yellow in colour.\n\nFrom assumption-2, the breed after cross pollination will have one factor from pure breed yellow (Y) and one from the pure breed green (y). That is, all the peas will have the paired factor \u2018Yy\u2019 and by assumption-3 all the peas will be Yellow as \u2018Y\u2019 factor is dominant.\n\n![](images/9081ae0493aa8a6bcc71eaa9ff334d69359343bc231af44bd6d84370d5960259.jpg)\n\n![](images/1eb2cb62a1854b43fa45075d85fd6a96e20e5006ae6d243b1b1d9b1ebce7106c.jpg)\n\nParental generation - Cross pollination\n\n![](images/0abd1fdaefe677938b380719aec533473cebcfaba1d10766473f3bcd6a7fe8e8.jpg)\n\n<table><tr><td>\u2640\u2642</td><td>y</td><td>y</td></tr><tr><td>Y</td><td>Yy</td><td>Yy</td></tr><tr><td>Y</td><td>Yy</td><td>Yy</td></tr></table>\n\nYy ... .

In chapter 7 \u201cDifferent Ecosystems\u201d of class $8 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ it was mentioned that all organisms in an ecosystem derive energy from food to live and sunlight is the main source of the energy. Food chain shows that how the energy is passed from one organism to another. At each transfer a large proportion (80 toAt 90 percent) of energy is dissipated as heat produced during the process of respiration and other reactions. After three steps in a food chain, very little energy is still available for top carnivores to use.\n\nWithin the biosphere there are a number of major ecosystems. The terrestrial ecosystems are determined largely by the variations in climatic conditions between the Poles and Equator. In a similar way, if you climb a mountain such as Kilimanjaro in Equatorial Africa or Himalayan mountains in our country. You quickly go through a comparable system of ecosystems,\n\nstarting with tropical rain forest at the base and ending with perpetual snow and ice at the summit.\n\nThe main climatic influences which determine these ecosystems are rainfall, temperature and the availability of light from the sun. For instance, forests are usually associated with high rainfall, but the type of forest is influenced by temperature and light. The same applies to deserts which occur in regions where rainfall is extremely low.\n\nBut these links are never as simple or rigid as the word \u2018chain\u2019 suggests. For example, aphids are eaten by many insectivorous birds in addition to warblers, and also ladybirds and other insects; hawks, on the other hand, prey upon a considerable variety of birds and small mammal-So the term food web is often a better one to use when being precise, as it suggests a far greater number of possible links and reflects the fact that the whole\n\ncommunity is a complex inter-connected unit. Thus the original energy from the sun flows through the whole ecosystem from one tropic level to another.", "response": "In Chapter 9 - Our environment - Our concern > Examples, the text discusses: ![](images/17feef91ff2e175b9e08df2f6f2368417c9c93b7a35c10e18c99d2c9c5c39282.jpg)\n\nWhy do most of the food chains consist of four steps?\n\nWhy do the nu..."}

Another niche for insects such as caterpillars which have strong jaws for biting off pieces of a leaf and a niche for relatively large animals such as deer which browse on the vegetation. All these animals feed on leaves but they differ both in size and in the manner in which they feed.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding Do you know?.", "context": "To reduce our dependence on fossil fuels (fuels formed by natural processes such as anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms, like coal, petrol etc.), and to help reduce air pollution, biomass can also be used as a source energy. Using biomass as fuel still puts carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, but it is the same carbon dioxide taken from the air as the biomass was produced.\n\nThe biomass in a trophic level may be more or less than the other trophic levels. Biomass is a measure of the amount of food available. When animals eat, only a small proportion of their food is converted into new tissue, which inturn forms the food for the next trophic level. Most of the biomass that animals eat is either not digested, or used to provide the energy needed for staying alive.\n\nThe biomass pyramid shows that animals are relatively inefficient in converting food into body tissues, the remaining part of the food being undigested is passed out as waste, or broken down in respiration to supply\n\nenergy for activities such as feeding. Many animals convert not more than $10 \\%$ of their food into their body tissues, in some herbivores, it is even less. Let us take an example of a food chain which has been worked out in some detail- one in which we are involved when we eat fish.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding Pyramid of Energy.", "context": "Food is the source of energy for organisms that are used in the growth and rebuilding the parts of the body; that are constantly wearing out. The food by its nature is the chemical energy and as in stored form, it is the potential energy. There are several mechanisms in organisms for continuous absorption of materials for the production of organic material, and for the release and conversion of organic material into inorganic form. Plants absorb the minerals from the soil. They are absorbed into the plant through roots.\n\n![](images/0000419f0caf1a4af97bf56920ce9e1aa38df2e9432a737e8488b58b444beb5b.jpg)  \nfig-7: Pyramid of Energy\n\nPhotosynthesis is an essential process for the life. The energy in sunlight, carbon dioxide and the water which are needed by all living things belong to nonliving things. As a result of photosynthesis, these can be made available in a suitable form of energy the food to the world of living things the animals or consumers, only by the green plants the producers. The food chains and food webs help in the transfer of the food and energy from the producers to different consumers. Animals obtain the minerals from the plant or animal food or both. Thus the mineral matter is constantly being removed from the earth to become a part of the plant, which may become a part of animal body.\n\nTry to identify the basic sources of various foods we eat. For example curd that we eat is processed from milk, which comes from a cow, which in turn eats grass. The grass carries out photosynthesis and prepares food. In every case, the origin of food materials can be traced back to green plants.\n\nOnce the food is eaten, its energy follows a variety of pattern through the organisms. Not all the food can be fully digested and assimilated. Hair, feathers, insect exoskeletons, cartilage and bone in animal foods, cellulose and lignin in plant foods cannot be digested by most animals. These\n\nmaterials are either ejected by defecation or regurgitated in pellets of indigested remains.\n\nAssimilated energy (that is not lost through respiration or excretion) is available for the synthesis of new biomass through growth and reproduction. Organisms lose some biomass by death, disease or annual leaf-drop, where they enter the detritus pathways of the food chain i.e., after the death and decomposition of organisms the materials flow back into the environment. The remaining biomass is eventually consumed by herbivores or predators and its energy there by enters the next higher trophic level in the ecosystem.\n\n![](images/d52b14d8ff5654d51b9ff18797e34775364b33270cc6e0df28529583d429d3a6.jpg)\n\nThe materials keep on cycling i.e. entering the living beings and through death and decay returning to the soil and atmosphere Such a flow of materials between organisms and their environment is called Cycling of materials or mineral circulation or Biogeochemical cycles (You have learnt in class IX ).\n\nEnergy enters the producers in the ecosystem from the sun in the form of solar energy or solar radiation.

The water holding capacity of the lake is also found significantly reduced.\n\nIn due course of time activities such as agriculture and industries came along in ever growing intensity in the catchment area of the lake. Consequently, the drains and rivulets carry substantial quantity of various types of pollutants into the lake.

In the entire history of sparrows around the world, they have never been hunted down as they were in China in 1958.\n\nA radical campaign to rapidly increase China\u2019s industrial output by mobilizing the country\u2019s vast rural peasantry took place at this time. It was set in motion\n\n![](images/5adadf52e5e116588cd808576a1dfdf59bffc835cd63572127f95b91f4e6d33b.jpg)  \nfig-9: Sparrow in danger\n\nby the government with the intention to achieve rapid increase in industrial production that China would catch up with the rest of the civilized world.

This initial success led to ambitious goals for the following year, but the weather didn\u2019t cooperate.

This over-reporting led to an imbalance between the demand and the supply. The sparrows were accused of pecking away at the supplies in warehouses at an officially estimated rate of four pounds of grain per sparrow per year. In the cities and the outskirts, almost half of the labour force was mobilized into the anti-sparrow army.\n\nPeople started trapping, poisoning and killing sparrows in large numbers. Several free-fire zones were set up for shooting the sparrows. People would beat drums to scare the birds from landing, so the sparrows were forced to keep flying until they dropped dead from fatigue. Sparrow nests were torn down, eggs were broken, and nestlings were killed. Non-material rewards and recognition were offered to schools, work units and government agencies in accordance with the number of sparrows killed.\n\nLater some scientists who cut open the digestive systems of dead sparrows found that three-fourth of the contents were of insects harmful for crops and only one-fourth contained grains. The scientific findings\n\nshowed that sparrows were basically a beneficial bird for humans. Rather than being increased, crop yields after the campaign were substantially decreased. Though the campaign against sparrows ended it was too late. With no sparrows to eat the locust populations, the country was soon swarmed. Locusts coupled with bad weather led to the Great Chinese Famine. Use of pesticides against locust population further degraded the land.\n\nInstead of working in the fields, millions of farmers had to leave their villages to work for industries. Very small area was left under agriculture and food shortages became everyday occurrence.\n\nWhat is the food chain that has been discussed in the above case?\n\nHow did the campaign disturb the food chain in the fields?\n\nHow did these disturbances affect the environment?\n\nIs it right to eradicate a living organism in an ecosystem ?How is it harmful?", "response": "In Chapter 9 - Our environment - Our concern > Sparrow campaign, the text discusses: Any living organism can\u2019t avoid crises since they are a normal part of life.

After using pesticides then also we are having a significant amount of loss of food material because of pests. Now you can imagine if pesticides were totally banned what would happen to the diseases? Are they really controlling the pests that effect the crops we vitally need for our growing population?\n\nThe long term solution to this problem is to find other effective methods of controlling pests which have far less harmful effects and are based on sound biological principles.\n\nHere are some of the important methods to be used.\n\nRotation of crops: Growing different crops on a particular piece of land in successive years reduces the occurence of pests and damage to the crops from year to year in that area.\n\nStudying the life histories of the pests: By understanding how the pests spread and its stages in life history, the seeds can be sown at that time to reduce the damage to the crop.\n\nBiological control: Introducing natural predators or parasites of the pests.\n\nSterility :Rendering the males of a pest species sterile\n\nGenetic strains: The development of genetic strains (genetically modified plants) which are resistant to certain pest.\n\nEnvironmental ethics: This is concerned with morality of human activities as they affect the environment.

Some of these resources can be replaced after they are used and are called renewable resources. Other resources, such as fossil fuels, cannot be replaced at all.

Billions of people use up resources quickly as they eat food, build houses, produce goods and burn fuel for transportation and electricity. The continuation of life as we know depends on the careful use of natural resources.\n\nThe need to conserve resources often conflicts with other needs. For some people, a forest area may be a good place to put a farm. A timber company may want to harvest the area\u2019s trees for construction materials. A business company may want to build a factory or shopping mall on the land. All these needs are valid for us, but sometimes the plants and animals that live in the area are forgotten.

Which are rich habitat for plants and animals. Forests serve as a lung for the world and a bed of nutrients for new life to prosper. They provide us innumerable products and in an urge to extract them we indiscriminately destroy them.\n\nPeople clear forests to use the wood, or to make way for farming or development. Each year, the Earth loses about 36 million acres of forest to deforestation.\n\nDeforestation destroys wildlife habitats and increases soil erosion. It also releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Deforestation accounts for 15 percent of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation also harms the people who rely on forests for their survival, hunting and gathering, harvesting forest products, or using the timber for firewood.\n\nSustainable forestry practices are critical for ensuring resources well into the future. Perhaps the bishnoi\u2019s of Rajasthan could tell us how. As we recall brave Amrita Devi and her daughters, followed by villagers who clung to trees in the forest surrounding their village and laid down their lives to save them, we are faced with a realization about how great a movement towards conservation can be. They were protesting against the Kings\u2019 order to collect wood for the construction of his palace and defending the pledge of peaceful coexistence taken by them as a bishnoi. It is a set of 29 rules to conserve natures\u2019 resources that every bishnoi vows to protect.\n\nAs you have already studied about the Chenchu and Gondu tribes of our state and are aware of how carefully they extract resources from nature and help revive it. (refer lesson of VII class - Forest our life)\n\nSome sustainable forestry methods include using low-impact logging practices, harvesting with natural regeneration in mind, and avoiding certain logging techniques, such as removing all the high-value trees or all the largest trees from a forest.\n\nTrees can also be conserved if consumers recycle. People in China and Mexico, for example, reuse much of their wastepaper, including writing paper, wrapping paper, and cardboard. If half the world\u2019s paper were recycled, much of the worldwide demand for new paper would be fulfilled, saving many of the Earth\u2019s trees. We can also replace some wood products with alternatives like bamboo, which is actually a type of grass, that grows very fast.", "response": "In Chapter 10 - Natural Resources > Forest: an important renewable resource, the text discusses: Why do you think forests are important?\n\nEvery continent except Antarctica has forests.

Soil is also important to plants that grow in the wild. Many other types of conservation efforts, such as plant conservation and animal conservation, depend on soil conservation.\n\nPoor farming methods, such as repeatedly planting the same type of crop in the same place, deplete nutrients in the soil. Soil erosion by water and wind increases when farmers plough up and down hills.\n\nOne soil conservation method is called contour strip cropping. Several crops, such as corn, wheat, and clover, are planted in alternating strips across a slope or across the path of the prevailing wind. Different crops, with different root systems and leaves, help to prevent soil erosion. Selective harvesting methods means we harvest mature commertial trees of a specific diameter on a rotational cycle to maintain the forest Ecobalance. Harvested areas are then closed for a prescribed period of time before the next harvest cycle in the same area. This provides younger trees a chance to grow full commertial potential while removing aged tress that would otherwise die naturally allowing forest to regenerate naturally.", "response": "In Chapter 10 - Natural Resources > Soil, the text discusses: Soil is vital to food production.

Through hunting, pollution, habitat destruction, people are speeding up the loss of biodiversity at an alarming rate.

Before we come to this, let us consider another question.\n\nWhen we compare different things, they could have similarities as well as differences. Which aspects do we use to compare them? Let us look at students in the class itself. How do we compare different students? They differ in their height, health, talents and interests. The healthiest student may not be the most studious one. The most intelligent student may not be the friendliest one. So, how do we compare students? The criterion we may use depends on the purpose of comparison. We use different criterion to choose a sports team, a debate team, a music team or a team to organise a picnic. Still, if for some purpose, we have to choose the criterion for the all-round progress of children in the class, how shall we do it?\n\nUsually we take one or more important characteristics ofimportant of persons and compare them based on these characteristics. on these characteristics. Ofon these characteristics. course, there can be differences about what are important characteristics that should form the basis of comparison: friendliness and spirit of cooperation, creativity or marks secured?\n\nThis is true of development too. For comparing countries, their income is considered to be one ofincome is be of the most important attributes.the important attributes. Countries with higher income are\n\nmore developed than others with less income. This is based on the understanding that more income means more of all things that human beings need. Whatever people like, and should have, they will be able to get with greater income. So, greater income itself is considered to be one important goal.\n\nNow, what is the income of a country? Intuitively, the income of the country is the income of all the residents of the country. This gives us the total income of the country.\n\nHowever, for comparison between countries, total income is not such an useful measure. Since, countries have different populations, comparing total income will not tell us what an average person is likely to earn. Are people in one country better off than others in a different country? Hence, we compare the average income which income is the total income of the country divided by its total population. The average income is also called per capita income.capita\n\nIn World Development Reports, brought out by the World Bank, this criterion is used in classifying countries. Countries with per capita income of US$ 49,300 per annum and above in 2019, are called high income or rich countries and those with per capita income of US$ 2500 or less are called low-income countries. India comes in the category of low middle income countries because its per capita income in 2019 was just $\\mathrm { U S } \\$ 8$ 6700 per annum.

Sectoral classification can be done on the basis of several criteria. In this chapter, three types of classifications are discussed: primary/secondary/tertiary; organised/ unorganised; and public/private. You can create a discussion about these types by taking examples familiar to the students and relate them to their daily life. It is important to emphasise the changing roles of sectors. This can be highlighted further by drawing attention of the students to the rapid growth of service sector. While elaborating the ideas provided in the chapter, the students may need to be familiarised with a few fundamental concepts such as Gross Domestic Product, Employment etc. Since the students may find this difficult to understand, it is necessary to explain to them through examples. Several activities and exercises are suggested in the chapter to help the students understand how a person\u2019s activity could be placed whether in the primary, secondary or tertiary, organised or unorganised, and public or private sector. You may encourage the students to talk to various working people around them (such as shop owners, casual workers, vegetable vendors, workshop mechanics, domestic workers etc.) to know more about how they live and work. Based on such information, the students can be encouraged to develop their own classification of economic activities.\n\nAnother important issue to be highlighted is about the problems caused by the changes in the roles of sectors. The chapter has taken the example of unemployment and what the government can do to solve it. The declining importance of agriculture and growing importance of\n\nindustry and services should be related to the experience of the children by taking more examples that they may observe in their day-to-day life. Information derived from the media could be used for this purpose. You may encourage the students to bring important cuttings and stories from newspapers, which could be prominently displayed in storyboards, and encourage the class to discuss these issues. While discussing the unorganised sector, the key issue of protecting the workers engaged in the sector should be highlighted. You may also encourage the students to visit persons and enterprises in the unorganised sector and get a first hand experience from real life situation.", "response": "In CHAPTER 2 - SECTORS OF THE INDIAN ECONOMY > NOTES FOR THE TEACHER, the text discusses: An economy is best understood when we study its components or sectors.

You will find that people are engaged in various economic activities. Some of these are activities producing goods. Some others are producing services. These activities are happening around us every minute even as we speak. How do we understand these activities? One way of doing this is to group them (classify them) using some important criterion. These groups are also called sectors.\n\n![](images/070ddc572749e50ca149773d1b897348266171997080c69dd995fec92a69ec0d.jpg)\n\n![](images/80002c90ad31b9640b9b0dbd569cf6559f2af62a69500614aa78ec161bc5abe6.jpg)\n\n![](images/d9650006e364cccc832cef6b726626a9ba3b13de09c7d045cd16fdc50cd2c130.jpg)\n\n![](images/92e96549c79404812c7ce9e12ecc3c1c248e6ca8e593b00d797b25b898a03cde.jpg)\n\n![](images/20c84418bc7097b06c19a6124cfd8af303a671a4c2755b9d797a728ecc8f0396.jpg)\n\nWe begin by looking at different kind of economic activities.\n\nThere are many activities that are undertaken by directly using natural resources. Take, for example, the cultivation of cotton. It takes place within a crop season. For the growth of the cotton plant, we depend mainly, but not entirely, not entirely, on natural factors like rainfall, sunshine and climate. The product of this activity, cotton, is a natural product. Similarly, in the case of an activity like dairy, we are dependent\n\n![](images/dfe960ca544ca32901aed5b5b242913acb91c04c09f4d5c60d7ebab7db5e77d9.jpg)\n\non the biological process of the animals and availability of fodder etc. The product here, milk, also is a natural product. Similarly, minerals and ores are also natural products. When we produce a good by exploiting natural resources, it is an activity of the primary sector. Why sector primary? This is because it forms the base for all other products that we subsequently make. Since most of the natural products we get are from agriculture, dairy, fishing, forestry, this sector is also\n\ncalled agriculture and related sector. sector\n\nThe secondary sector covers activities in which natural products are changed into other forms through ways of manufacturing that we associate with industrial activity. It is the next step after primary. The product is not produced by nature but has to be made and therefore some process of manufacturing is essential. This could be in a factory, a workshop or at home. For example, using cotton fibre from the plant, we\n\nspin yarn and weave cloth. Using sugarcane as a raw material, we make sugar or gur. We convert earth into bricks and use bricks to make houses and buildings. Since this sector gradually became associated with the different kinds of industries that came up, it is also called as industrial sector.", "response": "In CHAPTER 2 - SECTORS OF THE INDIAN ECONOMY > SECTORS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES, the text discusses: Let us look at these pictures.

These are activities that help in the development of the primary and secondary sectors. These activities, by themselves, do not produce a good but they are an aid or a support for the production process. For example, goods that are produced in the primary or secondary sector would need to be transported by trucks or trains and then sold in wholesale and retail shops. At times, it may be necessary to store these in godowns. We also may need to talk to others over telephone or send letters (communication) or borrow money from banks (banking) to help production and trade. Transport, storage, communication, banking, trade are some examples of tertiary activities. Since these activities generate services rather than goods, the tertiary sector is also called the service sector.service sector\n\nService sector also includes some essential services that may not directly help in the production of goods. For example, we require teachers, doctors, and those who provide personal services such as washermen, barbers, cobblers, lawyers, and people to do administrative and accounting works.

Not only would the task be enormous, you might also wonder how we can add up cars and computers and nails and furniture. It won\u2019t make sense!!!\n\nYou are right in thinking so. To get around this problem, economists suggest that the values of goods and services should be used rather than adding up the actual numbers. For example, if 10,000 kgs of wheat is sold at Rs 20 per kg, the value of wheat will be Rs 2,00,000. The value of 5000 coconuts at Rs 15 per coconut will be Rs 75,000. Similarly, the value of goods and services in the three sectors are calculated, and then added up.\n\nRemember, there is one precaution one has to take. Not every good (or service) that is produced and sold needs to be counted. It makes sense only to include the final goods and services. services Take, for instance, a farmer who sells wheat to a flour mill for Rs 20 per kg. The mill grinds the wheat and sells the flour to a biscuit company for Rs 25 per kg. The biscuit company uses the flour and things such as sugar and oil to make four packets of biscuits. It sells biscuits in the market to the consumers for Rs 80 (Rs 20 per packet). Biscuits are the final goods, i.e., goods that reach the consumers.\n\nWhy are only \u2018final goods and services\u2019 counted? In contrast to final goods, goods such as wheat and the wheat flour in this example are intermediate goods. Intermediate goods are used up in producing final goods and services. The value of final goods already includes the already includes value of all the intermediate goods that are used in making the final good. Hence, the value of Rs 80 for the biscuits (final good) already includes the value of flour (Rs 25). Similarly, the value of all other intermediate goods would have been included. To count the value of the flour and wheat\n\n![](images/fde3e67ba09bf22d15010866ef1f1464a2f7b194461af784472e112d53b45146.jpg)\n\nseparately is therefore not correct because then we would be counting the value of the same things a number of times. First as wheat, then as flour and finally as biscuits.\n\nThe value of final goods and services produced in each sector during a particular year provides the total production of the sector for that year. A nd the sum of . production in the three sectors gives what is called the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Product (GDP) a country. It is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country during a particular year. GDP shows how big the economy is.\n\nIn India, the mammoth task of measuring GDP is undertaken by a central government ministry.

Many people could now take up other activities. There were increasing number of craftpersons and traders. Buying and selling activities increased many times. Besides, there were also transporters, administrators, army etc. However, at this stage, most of the goods produced were natural products from the primary sector and most people were also employed in this sector.\n\nOver a long time (more than hundred years), and especially because new methods of manufacturing were introduced, factories came up and started expanding. Those people who had earlier worked on farms now began to work in factories in large numbers. They were forced to do so as you read in history chapters. People began to use many more goods that were produced in factories at cheap rates. Secondary sector gradually became the most important in total production and employment. Hence, over time, a shift had taken place. This means that the importance of the sectors had changed.\n\nIn the past 100 years, there has been a further shift from secondary to tertiary sector in developed countries. The service sector has become the most important in terms of total production. Most of the working people are also employed in the service sector.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding Rising Importance of the Tertiary Sector in Production.", "context": "Over the forty years between 1973-74 and 2013-14, while production in all the three sectors has increased, it has increased the most in the tertiary sector. As a result, in the year 2013-14, the tertiary sector has emerged as the largest producing sector in India replacing the primary sector.\n\nWhy is the tertiary sector becoming so important in India? There could be several reasons.\n\nFirst, in any country several services such as hospitals, educational institutions, post and telegraph services, police stations, courts, village administrative offices, municipal corporations, defence, transport, banks, insurance companies, etc. are required. These can be considered as basic services. In a developing country the government has to take responsibility for the provision of these services.\n\nSecond, the development of agriculture and industry leads to the development of services such as\n\ntransport, trade, storage and the like, as we have already seen. Greater the development of the primary and secondary sectors, more would be the demand for such services.\n\nThird, as income levels rise, certain sections of people start demanding many more services like eating out, tourism, shopping, private hospitals, private schools, professional training etc. You can see this change quite sharply in cities, especially in big cities.\n\nFourth, over the past decade or so, certain new services such as those based on information and communication technology have become important and essential. The production of these services has been rising rapidly. In Chapter 4, we shall see examples of these new services and the reasons for their expansion.\n\nHowever, you must remember that not all of the service sector is growing equally well. Service sector in India employs many different kinds of people. At one end there are a limited number of services that employ highly skilled and educated workers. At the other end, there are a very large number of workers engaged in services such as small shopkeepers, repair persons, transport persons, etc. These people barely manage to earn a living and yet they perform these services because no alternative opportunities for work are available to them. Hence, only a part of this sector is growing in importance.

Graph 3 shows the share of employment in the three sectors in 1977-78 and 2017-18. The primary sector continues to be the largest employer even now.\n\n![](images/c909fc5fd82007785ac1a0c2d208e52278e34201b565b8a0ffb512645a7b2a64.jpg)\n\nWhy didn\u2019t a similar shift out of primary sector happen in case of employment? It is because not enough jobs were created in the secondary and tertiary sectors.\n\nEven though industrial output or the production of goods went up by more than nine times during the period, employment in the industry went up by around three times. The same applies to the tertiary sector as well. While production in the service sector rose by 14 times, employment in the service sector rose around five times.\n\nAs a result, more than half of the workers in the country are working in the primary sector, mainly in agriculture, producing only about one sixth of the GDP. In contrast to this, the secondary and tertiary sectors produce the rest of the produce whereas they employ less about half the people. Does this mean that the workers in agriculture are not producing as much as they could?\n\nWhat it means is that there are more people in agriculture than is necessary. So, even if you move a few people out, production will not be affected. In other words, workers in the agricultural sector are underemployed. underemployed\n\nFor instance, take the case of a small farmer, Laxmi, owning about two hectares of unirrigated land dependent only on rain and growing crops, like jowar and arhar. All five members of her family work in the plot throughout the year. Why? They have nowhere else to go for work. You will see that everyone is working, none remains idle, but in actual fact, their labour effort gets divided. Each one is doing some work but no one is fully employed. This is the situation of underemployment, where people are apparently working but all of them are made to work less\n\nthan their potential. This kind ofkind underemployment is hidden in contrast to someone who does not have a job and is clearly visible as unemployed. Hence, it is also called disguised unemployment. called disguised unemployment.\n\nNow, supposing a landlord, Sukhram, comes and hires one or two members of the family to work on his land. Laxmi\u2019s family is now able to earn some extra income through wages. Since you do not need five people to look after that small plot, two people moving out does not affect production on their farm. In the above example, two people may move to work in a factory. Once again the earnings of the family would increase and they would also continue to produce as much from their land.", "response": "In CHAPTER 2 - SECTORS OF THE INDIAN ECONOMY > Where are most of the people employed?, the text discusses: Graph 2 presents percentage share of the three sectors in GDP.

For example there are thousands of casual workers in the service sector in urban areas who search for daily employment. They are employed as painters, plumbers, repair persons and others doing odd jobs. Many of them don\u2019t find work everyday.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding How to Create More Employment?.", "context": "From the above discussion, we can see that there continues to be considerable underemployment in agriculture. There are also people who are not employed at all. In what ways can one increase employment for people? Let us look at some of them.\n\nTake the case of Laxmi with her two-hectare plot of unirrigated land. The government can spend some money or banks can provide a loan, to construct a well for her family to irrigate the land. Laxmi will then be able to irrigate her land and take a second crop, wheat, during the rabi season. Let us suppose that one hectare of wheat can provide employment to two people for 50 days (including sowing, watering, fertiliser\n\napplication and harvesting). So, two more members of the family can be employed in her own field. Now suppose a new dam is constructed and canals are dug to irrigate many such farms. This could lead to a lot of employment generation within the agricultural sector itself reducing the problem of underemployment.\n\nNow, suppose Laxmi and other farmers produce much more than before. They would also need to sell some of this. For this they may be required to transport their products to a nearby town. If the government invests some money in transportation and storage of crops, or makes better rural roads so that mini-trucks reach everywhere several farmers like Laxmi, who now have access to water, can continue to grow and sell these crops. This activity can provide productive employment to not just farmers but also others such as those in services like transport or trade.\n\nLaxmi\u2019s need is not confined to water alone. To cultivate the land, she also needs seeds, fertilisers, agricultural equipment and pumpsets to draw water. Being a poor farmer, she cannot afford many of these. So,\n\nshe will have to borrow money from moneylenders and pay a high rate of interest. If the local bank gives her credit at a reasonable rate of interest, she will be able to buy all these in time and cultivate her land. This means that along with water, we also need to provide cheap agricultural credit to the farmers for farming to improve. We will look at some of these needs in Chapter 3, Money and Credit.", "response": "In CHAPTER 2 - SECTORS OF THE INDIAN ECONOMY > How to Create More Employment?, the text discusses: From the above discussion, we can see that there continues to be considerable underemployment in agriculture.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding How to Create More Employment?.", "context": "Another way by which we can tackle this problem is to identify, promote and locate industries and services in semi-rural areas where a large number of people may be employed. For instance, suppose many farmers decide to grow arhar and chickpea (pulse crops). Setting up a dal mill to procure and process these and sell in the cities is one such example. Opening a cold storage could give an opportunity for farmers to store their products like potatoes and onions and sell them when the price is good. In villages near forest areas, we can start honey collection centres where farmers can come and sell wild honey. It is also possible to set up industries that process vegetables and agricultural produce like potato, sweet potato, rice, wheat, tomato, fruits, which can be sold in outside markets. This will provide employment in industries located in semi-rural areas and not necessarily in large urban centres.\n\nWhat groups of people do you 1thinkare unemployed or underemployed in your area?

If these children are to attend schools, we will require more buildings, more teachers and other staff. A study conducted by the erstwhile Planning Commission (now known as NITI Aayog) estimates that nearly 20 lakh jobs can be created in the education sector alone. Similarly, if we are to improve the health situation, we need many more doctors, nurses, health workers etc. to work in rural areas. These are some ways by which jobs would be created and we would also be able to address the important aspects of development talked about in Chapter 1.\n\nEvery state or region has potential for increasing the income and employment for people in that area. It could be tourism, or regional craft industry, or new services like IT. Some of these would require proper planning and support from the government.

He can be asked to leave anytime by his employer.\n\nDo vou see the differences in the conditions of work teeween Kanta and Kamal?\n\nKanta works in the organised organised sector. Organised sector covers those enterprises or places of work where the terms of employment are regular and therefore, people have assured work. They are registered by the government and have to follow its rules and regulations which are given in various laws such as the Factories Act, Minimum Wages Act, Payment of Gratuity Act, Shops and Establishments Act etc. It is called organised because it has some formal processes and\n\nprocedures. Some of these people may not be employed by anyone but may work on their own but they too have to register themselves with the government and follow the rules and regulations.\n\nWorkers in the organised sector enjoy security of employment. They are expected to work only a fixed number of hours. If they work more, they have to be paid overtime by the employer. They also get several other benefits from the employers. What are\n\nthese benefits? They get paid leave, payment during holidays, provident fund, gratuity etc. They are supposed to get medical benefits and, under the laws, the factory manager has to ensure facilities like drinking water and a safe working environment. When they retire, these workers get pensions as well.\n\nIn contrast, Kamal works in the unorganised sector. The unorganised sector sector is characterised by small and scattered units which are largely outside the control of the government. There are rules and regulations but these are not followed. Jobs here are low-paid and\n\noften not regular. There is no provision for overtime, paid leave, holidays, leave due to sickness etc. Employment is not secure. People can be asked to leave without any reason. When there is less work, such as during some seasons, some people may be asked to leave. A lot also depends on the whims of the employer.

But the employment opportunities in the organised sector have been expanding very slowly. It is also common to find many organised sector enterprises in the unorganised sector. They adopt such strategies to evade taxes and refuse to follow laws that protect labourers. As a result, a large number of workers are forced to enter the unorganised sector jobs, which pay a very low salary. They are often exploited and not paid a fair wage. Their earnings are low and not regular. These jobs are not secure and have no other benefits.\n\nSince the 1990s, it is also common to see a large number of workers losing their jobs in the organised sector. These workers are forced to take up jobs in the unorganised sector with low earnings. Hence, besides the need for more work, there is also a need for protection and support of the workers in the unorganised sector.\n\nWho are these vulnerable people who need protection? In the rural areas, the unorganised sector mostly comprises of landless agricultural labourers, small and marginal farmers, sharecroppers and artisans (such as weavers, blacksmiths, carpenters and goldsmiths). Nearly 80 per cent of rural households in India are in small and marginal farmer category. These farmers need to be supported through adequate facility for timely delivery of seeds, agricultural inputs, credit, storage facilities and marketing outlets.\n\nIn the urban areas, unorganised sector comprises mainly of workers in small-scale industry, casual workers in construction, trade and transport etc., and those who work as street vendors, head load workers, garment makers, rag pickers etc. Small-scale industry also needs government\u2019s support for procuring raw material and marketing of output. The casual workers in both rural and urban areas need to be protected.\n\nWe also find that majority of workers from scheduled castes,\n\ntribes and backward communities find themselves in the unorganised sector. Besides getting the irregular and low paid work, these workers also face social discrimination. Protection and support to the unorganised sector workers is thus necessary for both economic and social development.\n\n![](images/d07ff84e01f08622e3625a93f288137fed89e0131906cddfab447d5d1378a6b3.jpg)\n\nWhen factories close down, many once regular workers are found selling goods or pushing a cart or doing some other odd job", "response": "In CHAPTER 2 - SECTORS OF THE INDIAN ECONOMY > How to Protect Workers in the Unorganised Sector?, the text discusses: The organised sector offers jobs that are the most sought-after.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding SECTORS IN TERMS OF OWNERSHIP: PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS.", "context": "Another way of classifying economic activities into sectors could be on the basis of who owns assets and is responsible for the delivery of services. In the public sector public , the government owns most of the assets and provides all the services. In the private private sector, ownership of assets and delivery of services is in the hands of private individuals or companies. Railways or post office is an example of the public sector whereas companies like Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited (TISCO) or Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) are privately owned.\n\nActivities in the private sector are guided by the motive to earn profits.\n\nTo get such services we have to pay money to these individuals and companies. The purpose of the public sector is not just to earn profits. Governments raise money through taxes and other ways to meet expenses on the services rendered by it. Modern day governments spend on a whole range of activities. What are these activities? Why do governments spend on such activities? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThere are several things needed by the society as a whole but which the private sector will not provide at a reasonable cost.at a reasonable cost. Why? Some ofat reasonable cost. these need spending large sums of money, which is beyond the capacity\n\nof the private sector. Also, collecting money from thousands of people who use these facilities is not easy. Even if they do provide these things they would charge a high rate for their use. Examples are construction of roads, bridges, railways, harbours, generating electricity, providing irrigation through dams etc. Thus, governments have to undertake such heavy spending and ensure that these facilities are available for everyone.\n\nThere are some activities, which the government has to support. The the to support private sector may not continue their production or business unless government encourages it. For example, selling electricity at the cost of generation may push up the costs of production of goods in many industries. Many units, especially small-scale units, might have to shut down. Government here steps in by producing and supplying electricity at rates which these industries can afford. Government has to bear part of the cost.\n\nSimilarly, the Government in India buys wheat and rice from farmers at a \u2018fair price\u2019. This it stores in its godowns and sells at a lower price to consumers through ration shops. You have read about this in the chapter on Food Security in Class IX. The\n\ngovernment has to bear some of the cost. In this way, the government supports both farmers and consumers.\n\nThere are a large number of activities which are the primary responsibility of the government. The government must spend on these. on these. Providing health and education facilities for all is one example. We have discussed some of these issues in the first chapter.

It is important to capture this element for the students. The history of money and how various forms were used at different times is an interesting story. At this stage the purpose is to allow students to realise the social situation in which these forms were used. Modern forms of money are linked to the banking system. This is the central idea of the first part of the chapter.\n\nThe present situation in India, where newer forms of money are slowly spreading with computerisation of the banking system, offers many opportunities to students to explore on their own. We need not get into a formal discussion of the \u2018functions of money\u2019 but let it come up as questions. There are certain areas that are not covered, such as \u2018creation of money\u2019 (money multiplier) or the backing of the modern system that may be discussed if you desire.\n\nAs you would see in the chapter, the stock of money consists of currency held by the public and the demand deposits that they hold with the banks. This is the money that people can use as they wish and the government has to ensure that the system works smoothy. What would happen when the government declares that some of the currency notes used by people would be made invalid and would be replaced by new currency? In India, during November 2016, currency notes in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 were declared invalid. People were asked to surrender these notes to the bank by a specific period and receive new Rs. 500, Rs. 2,000 or other currency notes. This is known as \u2018demonetisation\u2019. Since then, people were also encouraged to use their bank deposits rather than cash for transactions. Hence, digital transactions started by using bank-to-bank transfer through the internet or mobile phones, cheques, ATM cards, credit cards, and Point of Sale (POS) swipe machines at shops. This is promoted to reduce the requirement of cash for transactions and also control corruption. Students could be asked to debate on the process and the impact of demonetisation. They can be guided to make\n\na collage of the major areas where people use digital and cash transactions which are legitimate and legal. They can also discuss the transactions which are legal and why.

This is kept as provision to pay the depositors who might come to withdraw money from the bank on any given day. Since, on any particular day, only some of its many depositors come to withdraw cash, the bank is able to manage with this cash.\n\nBanks use the major portion of the deposits to extend loans.

The informal lenders include moneylenders, traders, employers, relatives and friends, etc. In Graph 1 you can see the various sources of credit to rural\n\nhouseholds in India. Is more credit coming from the formal sector or the informal sector?\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India supervises the functioning of formal sources of loans. For instance, we have seen that the banks maintain a minimum cash balance out of the deposits they receive. The RBI monitors the banks in actually maintaining cash balance. Similarly,\n\n![](images/86ee9401c98d9b6cbb03bd214f0229267ad68802188b041a836c3eb478d39d26.jpg)  \nGraph 1 : Sources of Credit per Rs 1000 of Rural Households in India in 2012\n\nthe RBI sees that the banks give loans not just to profit-making businesses and traders but also to small cultivators, small scale industries, to small borrowers etc. Periodically, banks have to submit information to the RBI on how much they are lending, to whom, at what interest rate, etc.\n\nThere is no organisation which supervises the credit activities of lenders in the informal sector They\n\n![](images/ba7d4c84bb62b2f140b13b9464e6617c0b0638d3bca65d260b380d6a5495d574.jpg)\n\nchoose. There is no one to stop them from using unfair means to get their money back.\n\nCompared to the formal lenders, most of the informal lenders charge a much higher interest on loans. Thus, the cost to the borrower of informal loans is much higher.\n\nHigher cost of borrowing means a larger part of the earnings of the borrowers is used to repay the loan. Hence, borrowers have less income left for themselves (as we saw for Shyamal in Sonpur). In certain cases, the high interest rate for borrowing can mean that the amount to be repaid is greater than the income of the borrower. This could lead to increasing debt (as we saw for Rama in Sonpur) and debt trap. Also, people who might wish to start an enterprise by borrowing may not do so because of the high cost of borrowing.\n\nFor these reasons, banks and cooperative societies need to lend\n\nmore. This would lead tohigher incomes and many people could then borrow cheaply for a variety of needs.

The people are divided into four groups, from poor to rich, as shown in the figure. You can see that 85 per cent of the loans taken by poor households in the urban areas are from informal sources. Compare this with the rich urban households. What do you find? Only 10 per cent of their loans are from informal sources, while 90 per cent are from formal sources. A similar pattern is also found in rural areas. The rich households are availing cheap credit from formal lenders whereas the poor households have to pay a large amount for borrowing.\n\nWhat does all this suggest? First, the formal sector still meets only about half of the total credit needs of the rural people. The remaining credit needs are met from informal sources.\n\n![](images/208593d3dc7603d9da63f55f5865ab72b26213cd94096e8a9fd94ad45d41835b.jpg)  \nGraph 2 : Of all the loans taken by urban housholds, what percentage was formal and what percentage was informal?   \npoor   \nhousholds\n\n![](images/fc4024a367560a760a64d359d69e7fb9f1c8dc30f750abc65adf3d5d338ccd34.jpg)  \nhouseholds   \nwith few assets\n\n![](images/a33be741bfe66cb43f17dee26c3c70050b00ea9809011627b4f999168d7cae9f.jpg)  \nwell-off   \nhouseholds\n\n![](images/46881a7e7be9d6e16886ef7e84fa7f8a441f2c3acd4065af017235a7cdab5eb6.jpg)  \nrich   \nhouseholds\n\nBLUE : Per cent of loans from the INFORMAL sector\n\nPURPLE : Per cent of loans from the FORMAL sector\n\nMost loans from informal lenders carry a very high interest rate and do little to increase the income of the borrowers.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding SELF-HELP GROUPS FOR THE POOR.", "context": "In the previous section we have seen that poor households are still dependent on informal sources of credit. Why is it so? Banks are not present everywhere in rural India. Even when they are present, getting a loan from a bank is much more difficult than taking a loan from informal sources. As we saw for Megha, bank loans require proper\n\ndocuments and collateral. Absence of collateral is one of the major reasons which prevents the poor from getting bank loans. Informal lenders such as moneylenders, on the other hand, know the borrowers personally and hence are often willing to give a loan without collateral. The borrowers can, if necessary, approach the moneylenders even without repaying\n\ntheir earlier loans. However, the moneylenders charge very high rates of interest, keep no records of the transactions and harass the poor borrowers.\n\nIn recent years, people have tried out some newer ways of providing loans to the poor. The idea is to organise rural poor, in particular women, into small Self Help Groups (SHGs) and pool (collect) their savings. A typical SHG has 15-20 members, usually belonging to one neighbourhood, who meet and save regularly. Saving per member varies from Rs 25 to Rs 100 or more, depending on the ability of the people to save. Members can take small loans from the group itself to meet their needs. The group charges interest on these loans but this is still less than what the moneylender charges. After a year or two, if the group is regular in savings, it becomes eligible for\n\navailing loan from the bank. Loan is sanctioned in the name of the group and is meant to create selfemployment opportunities for the members. For instance, small loans are provided to the members for releasing mortgaged land, for meeting working capital needs (e.g. buying seeds, fertilisers, raw materials like bamboo and cloth), for housing materials, for acquiring assets like sewing machine, handlooms, cattle, etc.\n\nMost of the important decisions regarding the savings and loan activities are taken by the group members. The group decides as regards the loans\n\nto be granted \u2014 the purpose, amount, interest to be charged, repayment schedule etc. Also, it is the group which is responsible for the repayment of the loan. Any case of non-repayment of loan by any one member is followed up seriously by other members in the group. Because of this feature, banks are willing to lend to the poor women when organised in SHGs, even though they have no collateral as such.\n\nThus, the SHGs help borrowers overcome the problem of lack of collateral. They can get timely loans for a variety of purposes and at a reasonable interest rate. Moreover, SHGs are the building blocks of organisation of the rural poor. Not only does it help women to become financially self-reliant, the regular meetings of the group provide a platform to discuss and act on a variety of social issues such as health, nutrition, domestic violence, etc.\n\n![](images/52359d57a9a549f1dc7a7423912ab92fd69685bad2b8c46732936b498200eb8a.jpg)  \nA women's self-help group", "response": "In CHAPTER 3 - MONEY AND CREDIT > SELF-HELP GROUPS FOR THE POOR, the text discusses: In the previous section we have seen that poor households are still dependent on informal sources of credit.

While this interconnectedness across countries has many dimensions cultural, political, social and economic \u2014 this chapter looks at globalisation in a more limited sense. It defines globalisation as the integration between countries through foreign trade and foreign investments by multinational corporations (MNCs). As you will notice, the more complex issues of portfolio investment have been left out.\n\nIf we look at the past thirty years or so, we find that MNCs have been a major force in the globalisation process connecting distant regions of the world. Why are the MNCs spreading their production to other countries and what are the ways in which they are doing so? The first part of the chapter discusses this. Rather than relying on quantitative estimates, the rapid rise and influence of the MNCs has been shown through a variety of examples, mainly drawn from the Indian context. Note that the examples are an aid to explain a more general point. While teaching, the emphasis should be on the ideas and examples are to be used as illustrations. You can also creatively use comprehension passages like the one given after Section II to test and reinforce new concepts.\n\nIntegration of production and integration of markets is a key idea behind understanding the process of globalisation and its impact. This has been dealt with at length in this chapter, highlighting the role of MNCs in the process. You have to ensure that the students grasp this idea with sufficient clarity, before moving on to the next topic.\n\nGlobalisation has been facilitated by several factors. Three of these have been highlighted: rapid improvements in technology, liberalisation\n\nof trade and investment policies and, pressures from international organisations such as the WTO. Improvement in technology is a fascinating area for students and you may, with a few directions, encourage them to do their own explorations. While discussing liberalisation, you have to keep in mind that the students are unaware of what India was like in the pre-liberalisation era. A role-play could be conceived to compare and contrast the pre and post-liberalisation era. Similarly, international negotiations under WTO and the uneven balances in power are interesting subjects that can be covered in a discussion mode rather than as lectures.\n\nThe final section covers the impact of globalisation. To what extent has globalisation contributed to the development process? This section draws on the topics covered in Chapters 1 and 2 (for example, what is a fair development goal), which you can refer to. Also, examples and activities drawn from the local environment are a must while discussing this section.

Second, MNCs might bring with them the latest technology for production.\n\n![](images/e934e64df24bf60f0688d9038d08037c066cff634e4674722f28cd72fe3244d5.jpg)  \nWEWILLSHIFT THIS FACTORY TO ER COUNTRY. S BECOME SIVE HERE!\n\nBut the most common route for MNC investments is to buy up local companies and then to expand production. MNCs with huge wealth can quite easily do so. To take an example, Cargill Foods, a very large American MNC,has bought over smaller Indian companies such as Parakh Foods.Parakh Foods had built a large marketing network in various parts of India,where its brand was well-reputed.Also,Parakh Foods had four oil refineries,whose control has now shifted to Cargill. Cargill is now the largest producer of edible oil in India, with a capacity to make 5 million pouches daily!\n\nIn fact, many of the top MNCs have wealth exceeding the entire budgets of the developing country governments. With such enormous wealth, imagine the power and influence of these MNCs!\n\nThere\u2019s another way in which MNCs control production. Large MNCs in developed countries place orders for production with small producers. Garments, footwear, sports items are examples of industries where production is carried out by a large number of small producers around the world.\n\n![](images/fabf0b1fe3645e9c3eed6a175b16945b5fb2d7ecd2461cef83a3d7a3b2a7c9ac.jpg)  \nWomen at home in Ludhiana making footballs for large MNCs\n\n![](images/d917b888a0bea8e4350f4d2e1389d72c294aaea8792da1dbc7c7f8c618c3f19b.jpg)  \nJeans produced in developing countries being sold in USA forRs 6500 ($145)\n\nThe products are supplied to the MNCs, which then sell these under their own brand names to the customers. These large MNCs have tremendous power to determine price, quality, delivery, and labour conditions for these distant producers.\n\nThus, we see that there are a variety of ways in which the MNCs are spreading their production and interacting with local producers in various countries across the globe. By setting up partnerships with local companies, by using the local companies for supplies, by closely competing with the local companies or buying them up, MNCs are exerting a strong influence on production at these distant locations.

Indian toy-makers will prosper.\n\nTax on imports is an example of trade barrier. It barrier is called a barrier because some restriction has been set up. Governments can use trade barriers to increase or decrease (regulate) foreign trade and to decide what kinds of goods and how much of each, should come into the country.\n\nThe Indian government, after Independence, had put barriers to foreign trade and foreign investment. This was considered necessary to protect the producers within the country from foreign competition. Industries were just coming up in the 1950s and 1960s, and competition from imports at that stage would not have allowed these industries to come up. Thus, India allowed imports of only essential items such as\n\nmachinery, fertilisers, petroleum etc. Note that all developed countries, during the early stages of development, have given protection to domestic producers through a variety of means.\n\nStarting around 1991, some farreaching changes in policy were made in India. The government decided that the time had come for Indian producers to compete with producers around the globe. It felt that competition would improve the performance of producers within the country since they would have to improve their quality. This decision was supported by powerful international organisations.\n\nThus, barriers on foreign trade and foreign investment were removed to a large extent. This meant that goods could be imported and exported easily and also foreign companies could set up factories and offices here.\n\nRemoving barriers or restrictions set by the government is what is known as liberalisation.known liberalisation.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding THE CONSUMER IN THE MARKETPLACE.", "context": "We participate in the market both as producers and consumers. As producers of goods and services we could be working in any of the sectors discussed earlier such as agriculture, industry, or services. Consumers participate in the market when they purchase goods and services that they need. These are the final goods that people as consumers use.\n\nIn the preceding chapters we discussed the need for rules and regulations or steps that would promote development. These could be for the protection of workers in the unorganised sector or to protect people from high interest rates charged by moneylenders in the informal sector. Similarly, rules and regulations are also required for protecting the environment.\n\nFor example, moneylenders in the informal sector that you read about in Chapter 3 adopt various tricks to bind the borrower: they could make the producer sell the produce to them at a low rate in return for a timely loan; they could force a small farmer like Swapna to sell her land to pay back the loan. Similarly, many people who work in the unorganised sector have to work at a low wage and accept conditions that are not fair and are also often harmful to their health. To prevent such exploitation, we have talked of rules and regulations for their protection. There are organisations that have struggled for long to ensure that these rules are 11\n\nLikewise, rules and regulations are required for the protection of the consumers in the marketplace. Individual consumers often find themselves in a weak position. Whenever there is a complaint regarding a good or service that had been bought, the seller tries to shift all the responsibility on to the buyer. Their position usually is \u2013 \u201cIf you didn\u2019t like what you bought, please go elsewhere\u201d. As if the seller has no responsibility once a sale is completed! The consumer movement, as we shall discuss later, is an effort to change this situation.\n\nExploitation in the marketplace happens in various ways. For example, sometimes traders indulge in unfair trade practices such as when shopkeepers weigh less than what they should or when traders add charges that were not mentioned before, or when adulterated/defective goods are sold.\n\nMarkets do not work in a fair manner when producers are few and powerful whereas consumers purchase in small amounts and are scattered. This happens especially when large companies are producing these goods. These companies with huge wealth, power and reach can manipulate the market in various ways. At times false information is passed on through the media, and other sources to attract consumers. For example, a company for years sold powder milk for babies all over\n\n![](images/96f1fa092915a63dfffdb79656b1493bf9f58ca319411e6737aa011fc50a3d47.jpg)", "response": "In CHAPTER 5 - CONSUMER RIGHTS > THE CONSUMER IN THE MARKETPLACE, the text discusses: We participate in the market both as producers and consumers.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding CONSUMER MOVEMENT.", "context": "The consumer movement arose out of dissatisfaction of the consumers as many unfair practices were being indulged in by the sellers. There was no legal system available to consumers to protect them from exploitation in the marketplace. For a long time, when a consumer was not happy with a particular brand product or shop, he or she generally avoided buying that brand product, or would stop purchasing from that shop. It was presumed that it was the responsibility of consumers to be careful while buying a commodity or service. It took many years for organisations in India, and around the world, to create awareness amongst people. This has also shifted the responsibility of ensuring\n\nquality of goods and services on the sellers.\n\nIn India, the consumer movement as a \u2018social force\u2019 originated with the necessity of protecting and promoting the interests of consumers against unethical and unfair trade practices. Rampant food shortages, hoarding, black marketing, adulteration of food and edible oil gave birth to the consumer movement in an organised form in the 1960s. Till the 1970s, consumer organisations were largely engaged in writing articles and holding exhibitions. They formed consumer groups to look into the malpractices in ration shops and overcrowding in the road passenger transport.

When you buy garments, you will find information on \u2018instructions for washing\u2019.\n\nWhy is it that rules have been made so that the manufacturer displays this information? It is because consumers have the right to be informed aboutinformed the particulars of goods and services that they purchase. Consumers can then complain and ask for compensation or replacement if the product proves to be defective in any manner. For example, if we buy a\n\nproduct and find it defective well within the expiry period, we can ask for a replacement. If the expiry period was not printed, the manufacturer would blame the shopkeeper and will not accept the responsibility. If people sell medicines that have expired severe action can be taken against them. Similarly, one can protest and complain if someone sells a good at more than the printed price on the packet. This is indicated by \u2018MRP\u2019 \u2014 maximum retail price. In fact consumers can bargain with the seller to sell at less than the MRP.\n\nIn recent times, the right to information has been expanded to cover various services provided by the Government.

There are many regions in our country that are rich in resources but these are included in economically backward regions. On the contrary there are some regions which have a poor resource base but they are economically developed.\n\nCan you name some resource rich but economically backward regions and some resource poor but economically developed regions? Give reasons for such a situation.\n\nThe history of colonisation reveals that rich resources in colonies were the main attractions for the foreign invaders. It was primarily the higher level of technological development of the colonising countries that helped them to exploit resources of other regions and establish their supremacy over the colonies. Therefore, resources can contribute to development only when they are accompanied by appropriate technological development and institutional changes. India has experienced all this in different phases of colonisation. Therefore, in India, development, in general, and resource development in particular does not only involve the availability of resources, but also the technology, quality of human resources and the historical experiences of the people.\n\nConservation of Resources: Resources are vital for any developmental activity. But irrational consumption and over-utilisation of resources may lead to socio-economic and environmental problems. To overcome these problems, resource conservation at various levels is important. This had been the main concern of the leaders and thinkers in the past. For example, Gandhiji was very apt in voicing his concern about resource conservation in these words: \u201cThere is enough\n\nfor everybody\u2019s need and not for any body\u2019s greed.\u201d He placed the greedy and selfish individuals and exploitative nature of modern technology as the root cause for resource depletion at the global level. He was against mass production and wanted to replace it with the production by the masses.\n\nAt the international level, the Club of Rome advocated resource conservation for the first time in a more systematic way in 1968. Subsequently, in 1974, Gandhian philosophy was once again presented by Schumacher in his book Small is Beautiful. The seminal contribution with respect to resource conservation at the global level was made by the Brundtland Commission Report, 1987. This report introduced the concept of \u2018Sustainable Development\u2019 and advocated it as a means for resource conservation, which was subsequently published in a book entitled Our Common Future. Another significant contribution was made at the Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992.", "response": "In Chapter 1 - RESOURCES AND PEVELOPMENT > Find out, the text discusses: What resources are being developed in your surroundings by the community/village panchayats/ward level communities with the help of community particip..."}

In the Chambal basin such lands are called ravines. Sometimes water flows as a sheet over large areas down a slope. In such cases the top soil is washed away. This is known as sheet erosion.

Nearly every household in the city has a rooftop rainwater harvesting structure. Nearly 15-25 per cent of the total water requirement of the household comes from rooftop water harvesting.\n\n## \n\nFind out other rainwater harvesting systems existing in and around your locality.\n\nToday, in western Rajasthan, sadly the practice of rooftop rainwater harvesting is on the decline as plenty of water is available due to the perennial Indira Gandhi Canal, though some houses still maintain the tankas since they do not like the taste of tap water. Fortunately, in\n\nmany parts of rural and urban India, rooftop rainwater harvesting is being successfully adapted to store and conserve water. In Gendathur, a remote backward village in Mysuru, Karnataka, villagers have installed, in their household\u2019s rooftop, rainwater harvesting system to meet their water needs.

The term ore is used to describe an accumulation of any mineral mixed with other elements. The mineral content of the ore must be in\n\nsufficient concentration to make its extraction commercially viable. The type of formation or structure in which they are found determines the relative ease with which mineral ores may be mined. This also determines the cost of extraction. It is, therefore, important for us to understand the main types of formations in which minerals occur.\n\nMinerals generally occur in these forms:\n\n(i) In igneous and metamorphic rocks minerals may occur in the cracks, crevices, faults or joints. The smaller occurrences are called veins and the larger are called lodes. In most cases, they are formed when minerals in liquid/ molten and gaseous forms are forced upward through cavities towards the earth\u2019s surface. They cool and solidify as they rise. Major metallic minerals like tin, copper, zinc and lead etc. are obtained from veins and lodes.   \n(ii) In sedimentary rocks a number of minerals occur in beds or layers. They have been formed as a result of deposition, accumulation and concentration in horizontal strata. Coal and some forms of iron ore have been concentrated as a result of long periods under great heat and pressure. Another group of sedimentary minerals include gypsum, potash salt and sodium salt. These are formed as a result of evaporation especially in arid regions.   \n(iii) Another mode of formation involves the decomposition of surface rocks, and the removal of soluble constituents, leaving a residual mass of weathered materialmaterial containing ores. Bauxite is formed this way.\n\n![](images/2a6c1d7c03b6e21915378d54a2ab33a12ad5dea26aa0ba9cd5dbade9711e22d4.jpg)  \nCLASSIFICATION OF MINERALS   \nFig. 5.1\n\n![](images/a8b5ece7f76dcd7dba2a825b796545cb47e39d53b3663c634a6d48574244fc11.jpg)\n\n(iv)Certain minerals may occur as alluvial alluvial deposits in s deposits ands of valley floors and the base of hills.

It is the only industry in the country, which is self-reliant and complete in the value chain i.e., from raw material to the highest value added products.\n\nCotton Textiles: In ancient India, cotton textiles were produced with hand spinning and handloom weaving techniques. After the $1 8 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ century, power-looms came into use. Our traditional industries suffered a setback during the colonial period because they could not compete with the mill-made cloth from England.\n\n\u2022 The first successful textile mill was established in Mumbai in 1854.   \n\u2022 The two world wars were fought in Europe, India was a British colony. There was a demand for cloth in U.K. hence, they gave a boost to the development of the cotton textile industry.\n\nIn the early years, the cotton textile industry was concentrated in the cotton growing belt of Maharashtra and Gujarat. Availability of raw cotton, market, transport including accessible port facilities, labour, moist climate, etc. contributed towards its localisation. This industry has close links with agriculture and provides a living to farmers, cotton boll pluckers and workers engaged in ginning, spinning, weaving,\n\ndyeing, designing, packaging, tailoring and sewing. The industry by creating demands supports many other industries, such as, chemicals and dyes, packaging materials and engineering works.\n\nWhile spinning continues to be centralised in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, weaving is highly decentralised to provide scope for incorporating traditional skills and designs of weaving in cotton, silk, zari, embroidery, etc. India has world class production in spinning, but weaving supplies low quality of fabric as it cannot use much of the high quality yarn produced in the country. Weaving is done by handloom, powerloom and in mills.\n\nThe handspun khadi provides large scale employment to weavers in their homes as a cottage industry.\n\nWhy did Mahatma Gandhi lay emphasis on spinning yarn and weaving khadi?\n\nWhy is it important for our country to keep the mill sector loomage lower than power loom and handloom?", "response": "In Chapter 6 - MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES > Agro-based Industries, the text discusses: Cotton, jute, silk, woollen textiles, sugar and edible oil, etc. industries are based on agricultural raw materials.\n\n![](images/bf3c3b491ed04468d24f3..."}

Industries are responsible for four types of pollution: (a) Air (b) Water (c) Land (d) Noise. The polluting industries also include thermal power plants.\n\nAir pollution is caused by the presence of high proportion of undesirable gases, such as sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide. Airborne particulate materials contain both solid and liquid particles like dust, sprays mist and smoke. Smoke is emitted by chemical and paper factories, brick kilns, refineries and smelting plants, and burning of fossil fuels in big and small factories that ignore pollution norms. Toxic gas leaks can be very hazardous with long-term effects. Are you aware of the Bhopal Gas tragedy that occurred? Air pollution adversely affects human health, animals, plants, buildings and the atmosphere as a whole.\n\nWater pollution is caused by organic and inorganic industrial wastes and affluents discharged into rivers. The main culprits in this regard are paper, pulp, chemical, textile and dyeing, petroleum refineries, tanneries and electroplating industries that let out dyes, detergents, acids, salts and heavy metals like lead and mercury pesticides, fertilisers, synthetic chemicals with carbon, plastics and rubber, etc. into the water bodies. Fly ash, phospo- gypsum and iron and steel slags are the major solid wastes in India.\n\nThermal pollution of water occurs when hot water from factories and thermal plants is drained into rivers and ponds before cooling. What would be the effect on aquatic life?\n\nWastes from nuclear power plants, nuclear and weapon production facilities cause cancers, birth defects and miscarriages. Soil iand and water pollution are closely related.\n\nDumping of wastes specially glass, harmful chemicals, industrial effluents, packaging, salts and garbage renders the soil useless. Rain water percolates to the soil carrying the pollutants to the ground and the ground water also gets contaminated.\n\nNoise pollution not only results in irritation and anger, it can also cause hearing impairment, increased heart rate and blood pressure among other physiological effects. Unwanted sound is an irritant and a source of stress. Industrial and construction activities, machinery, factory equipment, generators, saws and pneumatic and electric drills also make a lot of noise.", "response": "In Chapter 6 - MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES > Information Technology and Electronics Industry, the text discusses: The electronics industry covers a wide range of products from transistor sets to television, telephones, cellular telecom, telephone exchange, radars,..."}

She is followed by the peoples of Germany, bearing the black, red and gold flag. Interestingly, at the time when Sorrieu created this image, the German peoples did not yet exist as a united nation \u2013 the flag they carry is an expression of liberal hopes in 1848 to unify the numerous German-speaking principalities into a nation-state under a democratic constitution. Following the German peoples are the peoples of Austria, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, Lombardy, Poland, England, Ireland, Hungary and Russia. From the heavens above, Christ, saints and angels gaze upon the scene. They have been used by the artist to symbolise fraternity among the nations of the world.\n\nThis chapter will deal with many of the issues visualised by Sorrieu in Fig. 1. During the nineteenth century, nationalism emerged as a force which brought about sweeping changes in the political and mental world of Europe. The end result of these changes was the emergence of the nation-state in place of the multi-national dynastic empires of Europe. The concept and practices of a modern state, in which a centralised power exercised sovereign control over a clearly defined territory, had been developing over a long period of time in Europe. But a nation-state was one in which the majority of its citizens, and not only its rulers, came to develop a sense of common identity and shared history or descent. This commonness did not exist from time immemorial; it was forged through struggles, through the actions of leaders and the common people.

A heroic past, great men, glory, that is the social capital upon which one bases a national idea. To have common glories in the past, to have a common will in the present, to have performed great deeds together, to wish to perform still more, these are the essential conditions of being a people. A nation is therefore a large-scale solidarity \u2026 Its existence is a daily plebiscite \u2026 A province is its inhabitants; if anyone has the right to be consulted, it is the inhabitant. A nation never has any real interest in annexing or holding on to a country against its will. The existence of nations is a good thing, a necessity even.

France, as you would remember, was a full-fledged territorial state in 1789 under the rule of an absolute monarch. The political and constitutional changes that came in the wake of the French Revolution led to the transfer of sovereignty from the monarchy to a body of French citizens. The revolution proclaimed that it was the people who would henceforth constitute the nation and shape its destiny.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the French revolutionaries introduced various measures and practices that could create a sense of collective identity amongst the French people. The ideas of la patrie (the fatherland) and le citoyen (the citizen) emphasised\n\nthe notion of a united community enjoying equal rights under a constitution. A new French flag, the tricolour, was chosen to replace the former royal standard. The Estates General was elected by the body of active citizens and renamed the National Assembly. New hymns were composed, oaths taken and martyrs commemorated, all in the name of the nation. A centralised administrative system was put in place and it formulated uniform laws for all citizens within its territory. Internal customs duties and dues were abolished and a uniform system of weights and measures was adopted. Regional dialects were discouraged and French, as it was spoken and written in Paris, became the common language of the nation.\n\nThe revolutionaries further declared that it was the mission and the destiny of the French nation to liberate the peoples of Europe from despotism, in other words to help other peoples of Europe to become nations.\n\nWhen the news of the events in France reached the different cities of Europe, students and other members of educated middle classes began setting up Jacobin clubs. Their activities and campaigns prepared the way for the French armies which moved into Holland, Belgium, Switzerland and much of Italy in the 1790s. With the outbreak of the revolutionary wars, the French armies began to carry the idea of nationalism abroad.\n\n![](images/7510407e8dfbccbd27ba75fd89f7807e220f1e652971328aa7c94c09bc041b65.jpg)\n\nFig. 2 \u2014 The cover of a German almanac designed by the journalist Andreas Rebmann in 1798.   \n![](images/c2fd534f08b73ae9b450b3e5220ca2c03ef1ca2da232a2ae53b474dd98255559.jpg)  \nThe image of the French Bastille being stormed by the revolutionary crowd has been placed next to a similar fortress meant to represent the bastion of despotic rule in the German province of Kassel.

Politically, it emphasised the concept of government by consent. Since the French Revolution, liberalism had stood for the end of autocracy and clerical privileges, a constitution and representative government through parliament. Nineteenth-century liberals also stressed the inviolability of private property.\n\nYet, equality before the law did not necessarily stand for universal suffrage. You will recall that in revolutionary France, which marked the first political experiment in liberal democracy, the right to vote and to get elected was granted exclusively to property-owning men. Men without property and all women were excluded from political rights. Only for a brief period under the Jacobins did all adult males enjoy suffrage. However, the Napoleonic Code went back to limited suffrage and reduced women to the status of a minor, subject to the authority of fathers and husbands. Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries women and non-propertied men organised opposition movements demanding equal political rights.\n\nIn the economic sphere, liberalism stood for the freedom of markets and the abolition of state-imposed restrictions on the movement of goods and capital.

To be revolutionary at this time meant a commitment to oppose monarchical forms that had been established after the Vienna Congress, and to fight for liberty and freedom. Most of these revolutionaries also saw the creation of nation-states as a necessary part of this struggle for freedom.\n\nOne such individual was the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Mazzini. Born in Genoa in 1807, he became a member of the secret society of the Carbonari. As a young man of 24, he was sent into exile in 1831 for attempting a revolution in Liguria. He subsequently founded two more underground societies, first, Young Italy in Marseilles, and then, Young Europe in Berne, whose members were like-minded young men from Poland, France, Italy and the German states. Mazzini believed that God had intended nations to be the natural units of mankind. So Italy could not continue to be a patchwork of small states and kingdoms. It had to be forged into a single unified republic within a wider alliance of nations. This unification alone could be the basis of Italian liberty. Following his model, secret societies were set up in Germany, France, Switzerland and Poland.

Culture played an important role in creating the idea of the nation: art and poetry, stories and music helped express and shape nationalist feelings.\n\nLet us look at Romanticism, a cultural movement which sought to develop a particular form of nationalist sentiment. Romantic artists and poets generally criticised the glorification of reason and science\n\nFig. 8 \u2014 The Massacre at Chios, Eugene Delacroix, 1824.   \n![](images/5ad11c7b675daeaa6ea254577fa2e19b41d2467fe70bf5692d03f2fca570289b.jpg)  \nThe French painter Delacroix was one of the most important French Romantic painters. This huge painting (4.19m x 3.54m) depicts an incident in which 20,000 Greeks were said to have been killed by Turks on the island of Chios. By dramatising the incident, focusing on the suffering of women and children, and using vivid colours, Delacroix sought to appeal to the emotions of the spectators, and create sympathy for the Greeks.\n\nand focused instead on emotions, intuition and mystical feelings. Their effort was to create a sense of a shared collective heritage, a common cultural past, as the basis of a nation.\n\nOther Romantics such as the German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803) claimed that true German culture was to be discovered among the common people \u2013 das volk. It was through folk songs, folk poetry and folk dances that the true spirit of the nation (volksgeist) was popularised. So collecting and recording these forms of folk culture was essential to the project of nation-building.\n\nThe emphasis on vernacular language and the collection of local folklore was not just to recover an ancient national spirit, but also to carry the modern nationalist message to large audiences who were mostly illiterate. This was especially so in the case of Poland, which had been partitioned at the end of the eighteenth century by the Great Powers \u2013 Russia, Prussia and Austria. Even though Poland no longer existed as an independent territory, national feelings were kept alive through music and language. Karol Kurpinski, for example, celebrated the national struggle through his operas and music, turning folk dances like the polonaise and mazurka into nationalist symbols.\n\nLanguage too played an important role in developing nationalist sentiments. After Russian occupation, the Polish language was forced out of schools and the Russian language was imposed everywhere. In 1831, an armed rebellion against Russian rule took place which was ultimately crushed. Following this, many members of the clergy in Poland began to use language as a weapon of national resistance. Polish was used for Church gatherings and all religious instruction. As a result, a large number of priests and bishops were put in jail or sent to Siberia by the Russian authorities as punishment for their refusal to preach in Russian. The use of Polish came to be seen as a symbol of the struggle against Russian dominance.", "response": "In Chapter 1 - The Rise of Nationalism in Europe > 3 The Age of Revolutions: 1830-1848 > 3.1 The Romantic Imagination and National Feeling, the text discusses: The development of nationalism did not come about only through wars and territorial expansion.

Small producers in towns were often faced with stiff competition from imports of cheap machine-made goods from England, where industrialisation was more advanced than on the continent.

On 18 May 1848, 831 elected representatives marched in a festive procession to take their places in the Frankfurt parliament convened in the Church of St Paul. They drafted a constitution for a German nation to be headed by a monarchy subject to a parliament. When the deputies offered the crown on these terms to Friedrich Wilhelm IV, King of Prussia, he rejected it and joined other monarchs to oppose the elected assembly. While the opposition of the aristocracy and military became stronger, the social basis of parliament eroded. The parliament was dominated by the middle classes who resisted the demands of workers and artisans and consequently lost their support. In the end troops were called in and the assembly was forced to disband.\n\nThe issue of extending political rights to women was a controversial one within the liberal movement, in which large numbers of women had participated actively over the years.

Nationalist sentiments were often mobilised by conservatives for promoting state power and achieving political domination over Europe.\n\nThis can be observed in the process by which Germany and Italy came to be unified as nation-states. As you have seen, nationalist feelings were widespread among middle-class Germans, who in 1848 tried to unite the different regions of the German confederation into a nation-state governed by an elected parliament. This liberal initiative to nation-building was, however, repressed by the combined forces of the monarchy and the military, supported by the large landowners (called Junkers) of Prussia.\n\nFrom then on, Prussia took on the leadership of the movement for national unification. Its chief minister, Otto von Bismarck, was the architect of this process carried out with the help of the Prussian army and bureaucracy. Three wars over seven years \u2013 with Austria, Denmark and France \u2013 ended in Prussian victory and completed the process of unification.

It was the result of a long-drawn-out process. There was no British nation prior to the eighteenth century. The primary identities of the people who inhabited the British Isles were ethnic ones \u2013 such as English, Welsh, Scot or Irish. All of these ethnic groups had their own cultural and political traditions. But as the English nation steadily grew in wealth, importance and power, it was able to extend its influence over the other nations of the islands. The English parliament, which had seized power from the monarchy in 1688 at the end of a protracted conflict, was the instrument through which a nation-state, with England at its centre, came to be forged. The Act of Union (1707) between England and Scotland that resulted in the formation of the \u2018United Kingdom of Great Britain\u2019 meant, in effect, that England was able to impose its influence on Scotland. The British parliament was henceforth dominated by its English members. The growth of a British identity meant that Scotland\u2019s distinctive culture and political institutions were systematically suppressed. The Catholic clans that inhabited the Scottish Highlands suffered terrible repression whenever they attempted to assert their independence. The Scottish Highlanders were forbidden to speak their Gaelic language or wear their national dress, and large numbers were forcibly driven out of their homeland.\n\nIreland suffered a similar fate. It was a country deeply divided between Catholics and Protestants. The English helped the Protestants of Ireland to establish their dominance over a largely Catholic country. Catholic revolts against British dominance were suppressed. After a failed revolt led by Wolfe Tone and his United Irishmen (1798), Ireland was forcibly incorporated into the United Kingdom in 1801. A new \u2018British nation\u2019 was forged through the propagation of a dominant English culture.

Artists in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries found a way out by personifying a nation. In other words they represented a country as if it were a person. Nations were then portrayed as female figures. The female form that was chosen to personify the nation did not stand for any particular woman in real life; rather it sought to give the abstract idea of the nation a concrete form. That is, the female figure became an allegory of the nation.\n\nYou will recall that during the French Revolution artists used the female allegory to portray ideas such as Liberty, Justice and the Republic. These ideals were represented through specific objects or symbols. As you would remember, the attributes of Liberty are the red cap, or the broken chain, while Justice is generally a blindfolded woman carrying a pair of weighing scales.\n\nSimilar female allegories were invented by artists in the nineteenth century to represent the nation. In France she was christened Marianne, a popular Christian name, which underlined the idea of a people\u2019s nation. Her characteristics were drawn from those of Liberty and the Republic \u2013 the red cap, the tricolour, the cockade.

During this period nationalist groups became increasingly intolerant of each other and ever ready to go to war. The major European powers, in turn, manipulated the nationalist aspirations of the subject peoples in Europe to further their own imperialist aims.\n\nThe most serious source of nationalist tension in Europe after 1871 was the area called the Balkans. The Balkans was a region of geographical and ethnic variation comprising modern-day Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Greece, Macedonia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro whose inhabitants were broadly known as the Slavs. A large part of the Balkans was under the control of the Ottoman Empire. The spread of the ideas of romantic nationalism in the Balkans together with the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire made this region very explosive. All through the nineteenth century the Ottoman Empire had sought to strengthen itself through modernisation and internal reforms but with very little success. One by one, its European subject nationalities broke away from its control and declared independence. The Balkan peoples based their claims for independence or political rights on nationality and used history to prove that they had once been independent but had subsequently been subjugated by foreign powers. Hence the rebellious nationalities in the Balkans thought of their struggles as attempts to win back their long-lost independence.\n\nAs the different Slavic nationalities struggled to define their identity and independence, the Balkan area became an area of intense conflict. The Balkan states were fiercely jealous of each other and each hoped to gain more territory at the expense of the others. Matters were further complicated because the Balkans also became the scene of big power rivalry. During this period, there was intense rivalry among the European powers over trade and colonies as well as naval and military might. These rivalries were very evident in the way the Balkan problem unfolded. Each power \u2013 Russia, Germany, England, Austro-Hungary \u2013 was keen on countering the hold of other powers over the Balkans, and extending its own control over the area. This led to a series of wars in the region and finally the First World War.\n\nFig. 20 \u2014 A map celebrating the British Empire.   \n![](images/96a83025d20db6cd7b0f78f014ec7ac7e72e862d76cf42ca4487165d8f922a3e.jpg)  \nAt the top, angels are shown carrying the banner of freedom.

New symbols and icons, new songs and ideas forged new links and redefined the boundaries of communities. In most countries the making of this new national identity was a long process. How did this consciousness emerge in India?\n\nIn India and as in many other colonies, the growth of modern nationalism is intimately connected to the anti-colonial movement. People began discovering their unity in the process of their struggle with colonialism. The sense of being oppressed under colonialism provided a shared bond that tied many different groups together. But each class and group felt the effects of colonialism differently, their experiences were varied, and their notions of freedom were not always the same. The Congress under Mahatma Gandhi tried to forge these groups together within one movement. But the unity did not emerge without conflict.\n\nIn an earlier textbook you have read about the growth of nationalism in India up to the first decade of the twentieth century.

It suggested that if the cause was true, if the struggle was against injustice, then physical force was not necessary to fight the oppressor. Without seeking vengeance or being aggressive, a satyagrahi could win the battle through nonviolence. This could be done by appealing to the conscience of the oppressor.

In 1917 he travelled to Champaran in Bihar to inspire the peasants to struggle against the oppressive plantation system. Then in 1917, he organised a satyagraha to support the peasants of the Kheda district of Gujarat.

Seeing violence spread, Mahatma Gandhi called off the movement.\n\nWhile the Rowlatt satyagraha had been a widespread movement, it was still limited mostly to cities and towns. Mahatma Gandhi now felt the need to launch a more broad-based movement in India. But he was certain that no such movement could be organised without bringing the Hindus and Muslims closer together. One way of doing this, he felt, was to take up the Khilafat issue. The First World War had ended with the defeat of Ottoman Turkey.

If Indians refused to cooperate, British rule in India would collapse within a year, and swaraj would come.\n\nHow could non-cooperation become a movement?

It should begin with the surrender of titles that the government awarded, and a boycott of civil services, army, police, courts and legislative councils, schools, and foreign goods.

Thousands of students left government-controlled schools and colleges, headmasters and teachers resigned, and lawyers gave up their legal practices. The council elections were boycotted in most provinces except Madras, where the Justice Party, the party of the non-Brahmans, felt that entering the council was one way of gaining some power \u2013 something that usually only Brahmans had access to.\n\nThe effects of non-cooperation on the economic front were more dramatic. Foreign goods were boycotted, liquor shops picketed, and foreign cloth burnt in huge bonfires. The import of foreign cloth halved between 1921 and 1922, its value dropping from Rs 102 crore to Rs 57 crore. In many places merchants and traders refused to trade in foreign goods or finance foreign trade. As the boycott movement spread, and people began discarding imported clothes and wearing only Indian ones, production of Indian textile mills and handlooms went up.\n\nBut this movement in the cities gradually slowed down for a variety of reasons. Khadi cloth was often more expensive than massproduced mill cloth and poor people could not afford to buy it. How then could they boycott mill cloth for too long? Similarly the boycott of British institutions posed a problem. For the movement to be successful, alternative Indian institutions had to be set up so that they could be used in place of the British ones. These were slow to come up.

The movement here was against talukdars and landlords who demanded from peasants exorbitantly high rents and a variety of other cesses. Peasants had to do begar and work at landlords\u2019 farms without any payment.

As the movement spread in 1921, the houses of talukdars and merchants were attacked, bazaars were looted, and grain hoards were taken over.

He felt the movement was turning violent in many places and satyagrahis needed to be properly trained before they would be ready for mass struggles. Within the Congress, some leaders were by now tired of mass struggles and wanted to participate in elections to the provincial councils that had been set up by the Government of India Act of 1919. They felt that it was important to oppose British policies within the councils, argue for reform and also demonstrate that these councils were not truly democratic. C. R. Das and Motilal Nehru formed the Swaraj Party within the Congress to argue for a return to council politics. But younger leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose pressed for more radical mass agitation and for full independence.\n\nIn such a situation of internal debate and dissension two factors again shaped Indian politics towards the late 1920s. The first was the effect of the worldwide economic depression. Agricultural prices began to fall from 1926 and collapsed after 1930. As the demand for agricultural goods fell and exports declined, peasants found it difficult to sell their harvests and pay their revenue. By 1930, the countryside was in turmoil.\n\nAgainst this background the new Tory government in Britain constituted a Statutory Commission under Sir John Simon. Set up\n\nin response to the nationalist movement, the commission was to look into the functioning of the constitutional system in India and suggest changes. The problem was that the commission did not have a single Indian member. They were all British.\n\nWhen the Simon Commission arrived in India in 1928, it was greeted with the slogan \u2018Go back Simon\u2019. All parties, including the Congress and the Muslim League, participated in the demonstrations. In an effort to win them over, the viceroy, Lord Irwin, announced in October 1929, a vague offer of \u2018dominion status\u2019 for India in an unspecified future, and a Round Table Conference to discuss a future constitution.

On 31 January 1930, he sent a letter to Viceroy Irwin stating eleven demands. Some of these were of general interest; others were specific demands of different classes, from industrialists to peasants. The idea was to make the demands wide-ranging, so that all classes within Indian society could identify with them and everyone could be brought together in a united campaign. The most stirring of all was the demand to abolish the salt tax. Salt was something consumed by the rich and the poor alike, and it was one of the most essential items of food. The tax on salt and the government monopoly over its production, Mahatma Gandhi declared, revealed the most oppressive face of British rule.\n\nMahatma Gandhi\u2019s letter was, in a way, an ultimatum. If the demands were not fulfilled by 11 March, the letter stated, the Congress would launch a civil disobedience campaign. Irwin was unwilling to negotiate. So Mahatma Gandhi started his famous salt march accompanied by 78 of his trusted volunteers. The march was over 240 miles, from Gandhiji\u2019s ashram in Sabarmati to the Gujarati coastal town of Dandi. The volunteers walked for 24 days, about 10 miles a day. Thousands came to hear Mahatma Gandhi wherever he stopped, and he told them what he meant by swaraj and urged them to peacefully defy the British. On 6 April he reached Dandi, and ceremonially violated the law, manufacturing salt by boiling sea water.\n\nThis marked the beginning of the Civil Disobedience Movement.

Being producers of commercial crops, they were very hard hit by the trade depression and falling prices. As their cash income disappeared, they found it impossible to pay the government\u2019s revenue demand. And the refusal of the government to reduce the revenue demand led to widespread resentment. These rich peasants became enthusiastic supporters of the Civil Disobedience Movement, organising their communities, and at times forcing reluctant members, to participate in the boycott programmes. For them the fight for swaraj was a struggle against high revenues. But they were deeply disappointed when the movement was called off in 1931 without the revenue rates being revised. So when the movement was restarted in 1932, many of them refused to participate.\n\nThe poorer peasantry were not just interested in the lowering of the revenue demand. Many of them were small tenants cultivating land they had rented from landlords. As the Depression continued and cash incomes dwindled, the small tenants found it difficult to pay their rent. They wanted the unpaid rent to the landlord to be remitted. They joined a variety of radical movements, often led by Socialists and Communists.

In a series of dramatic actions in different parts of India, the HSRA targeted some of the symbols of British power. In April 1929, Bhagat Singh and Batukeswar Dutta threw a bomb in the Legislative Assembly. In the same year there was an attempt to blow up the train that Lord Irwin was travelling in. Bhagat Singh was 23 when he was tried and executed by the colonial government.

Keen on expanding their business, they now reacted against colonial policies that restricted business activities. They wanted protection against imports of foreign goods, and a rupee-sterling foreign exchange ratio that would discourage imports. To organise business interests, they formed the Indian Industrial and Commercial Congress in 1920 and the Federation of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FICCI) in 1927. Led by prominent industrialists like Purshottamdas Thakurdas and G. D. Birla, the industrialists attacked colonial control over the Indian economy, and supported the Civil Disobedience Movement when it was first launched. They gave financial assistance and refused to buy or sell imported goods. Most businessmen came to see swaraj as a time when colonial restrictions on business would no longer exist and trade and industry would flourish without constraints.

For long the Congress had ignored the dalits, for fear of offending the sanatanis, the conservative high-caste Hindus. But Mahatma Gandhi declared that swaraj would not come for a hundred years if untouchability was not eliminated. He called the \u2018untouchables\u2019 harijan,\n\n### Discuss\n\nWhy did various classes and groups of Indians participate in the Civil Disobedience Movement?\n\nor the children of God, organised satyagraha to secure them entry into temples, and access to public wells, tanks, roads and schools. He himself cleaned toilets to dignify the work of the bhangi (the sweepers), and persuaded upper castes to change their heart and give up \u2018the sin of untouchability\u2019. But many dalit leaders were keen on a different political solution to the problems of the community. They began organising themselves, demanding reserved seats in educational institutions, and a separate electorate that would choose dalit members for legislative councils. Political empowerment, they believed, would resolve the problems of their social disabilities. Dalit participation in the Civil Disobedience Movement was therefore limited, particularly in the Maharashtra and Nagpur region where their organisation was quite strong.\n\nDr B.R. Ambedkar, who organised the dalits into the Depressed Classes Association in 1930, clashed with Mahatma Gandhi at the second Round Table Conference by demanding separate electorates for dalits. When the British government conceded Ambedkar\u2019s demand, Gandhiji began a fast unto death. He believed that separate electorates for dalits would slow down the process of their integration into society. Ambedkar ultimately accepted Gandhiji\u2019s position and the result was the Poona Pact of September 1932. It gave the Depressed Classes (later to be known as the Schedule Castes) reserved seats in provincial and central legislative councils, but they were to be voted in by the general electorate. The dalit movement, however, continued to be apprehensive of the Congressled national movement.\n\nSome of the Muslim political organisations in India were also lukewarm in their response to the Civil Disobedience Movement. After the decline of the Non-Cooperation-Khilafat movement, a large section of Muslims felt alienated from the Congress. From the mid-1920s the Congress came to be more visibly associated with openly Hindu religious nationalist groups like the Hindu Mahasabha. As relations between Hindus and Muslims worsened, each community organised religious processions with militant fervour, provoking Hindu-Muslim communal clashes and riots in various cities. Every riot deepened the distance between the two communities.\n\nThe Congress and the Muslim League made efforts to renegotiate an alliance, and in 1927 it appeared that such a unity could be forged.

This is what he said:\n\n\u2018I have no hesitation in declaring that if the principle that the Indian Muslim is entitled to full and free development on the lines of his own culture and tradition in his own Indian home-lands is recognised as the basis of a permanent communal settlement, he will be ready to stake his all for the freedom of India. The principle that each group is entitled to free development on its own lines is not inspired by any feeling of narrow communalism \u2026 A community which is inspired by feelings of ill-will towards other communities is low and ignoble.

The Muslim demand for the creation of a Muslim India within India is, therefore, perfectly justified\u2026\n\n\u2018The Hindu thinks that separate electorates are contrary to the spirit of true nationalism, because he understands the word \u201cnation\u201d to mean a kind of universal amalgamation in which no communal entity ought to retain its private individuality. Such a state of things, however, does not exist. India is a land of racial and religious variety.

Notice how Tilak is surrounded by symbols of unity. The sacred institutions of different faiths (temple, church, masjid) frame the central figure.\n\nNationalism spreads when people begin to believe that they are all part of the same nation, when they discover some unity that binds them together. But how did the nation become a reality in the minds of people? How did people belonging to different communities, regions or language groups develop a sense of collective belonging?\n\nThis sense of collective belonging came partly through the experience of united struggles. But there were also a variety of cultural processes through which nationalism captured people\u2019s imagination. History and fiction, folklore and songs, popular prints and symbols, all played a part in the making of nationalism.\n\nThe identity of the nation, as you know (see Chapter 1), is most often symbolised in a figure or image. This helps create an image with which people can identify the nation. It was in the twentieth century, with the growth of nationalism, that the identity of India came to be visually associated with the image of Bharat Mata. The image was first created by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. In the 1870s he wrote \u2018Vande Mataram\u2019 as a hymn to the motherland. Later it was included in his novel Anandamath and widely sung during the Swadeshi movement in Bengal. Moved by the Swadeshi movement, Abanindranath Tagore painted his famous image of Bharat Mata (see Fig. 12). In this painting Bharat Mata is portrayed as an ascetic figure; she is calm, composed, divine and spiritual. In subsequent years, the image of Bharat Mata acquired many different forms, as it circulated in popular prints, and was painted by different artists (see Fig. 14). Devotion to this mother figure came to be seen as evidence of one\u2019s nationalism.\n\nIdeas of nationalism also developed through a movement to revive Indian folklore. In late-nineteenth-century India, nationalists began recording folk tales sung by bards and they toured villages to gather folk songs and legends. These tales, they believed, gave a true picture of traditional culture that had been corrupted and damaged by outside forces. It was essential to preserve this folk tradition in order to discover one\u2019s national identity and restore a sense of pride in one\u2019s past. In Bengal, Rabindranath Tagore himself began collecting ballads, nursery rhymes and myths, and led the movement for folk\n\n![](images/5d234d22cf00e5523fe5cbfc23c79c8a9f30c6a7dd89de9f09ac7523b6d8f47d.jpg)\n\n![](images/07c95da2b4a3e8bdba4d78a656e0729a424dac20aad65e511ac0eefc98d778ab.jpg)  \nFig. 13 \u2013 Jawaharlal Nehru, a popular print.\n\nFig. 12 \u2013 Bharat Mata, Abanindranath Tagore, 1905.\n\nNotice that the mother figure here is shown as dispensing learning, food and clothing.

He believed that folklore was national literature; it was \u2018the most trustworthy manifestation of people\u2019s real thoughts and characteristics\u2019.\n\nAs the national movement developed, nationalist leaders became more and more aware of such icons and symbols in unifying people and inspiring in them a feeling of nationalism. During the Swadeshi movement in Bengal, a tricolour flag (red, green and yellow) was designed. It had eight lotuses representing eight provinces of British India, and a crescent moon, representing Hindus and Muslims. By 1921, Gandhiji had designed the Swaraj flag. It was again a tricolour (red, green and white) and had a spinning wheel in the centre, representing the Gandhian ideal of self-help. Carrying the flag, holding it aloft, during marches became a symbol of defiance.\n\nAnother means of creating a feeling of nationalism was through reinterpretation of history. By the end of the nineteenth century many Indians began feeling that to instill a sense of pride in the nation, Indian history had to be thought about differently. The British saw Indians as backward and primitive, incapable of governing themselves. In response, Indians began looking into the past to discover India\u2019s great achievements. They wrote about the glorious developments in ancient times when art and architecture, science and mathematics, religion and culture, law and philosophy, crafts and trade had flourished. This glorious time, in their view, was followed by a history of decline, when India was colonised. These nationalist histories urged the readers to take pride in India\u2019s great achievements in the past and struggle to change the miserable conditions of life under British rule.\n\nThese efforts to unify people were not without problems.

The call for \u2018Quit India\u2019 almost brought the state machinery to a standstill in large parts of the country as people voluntarily threw themselves into the thick of the movement. People observed hartals, and demonstrations and processions were accompanied by national songs and slogans. The movement was truly a mass movement which brought into its ambit thousands of ordinary people, namely students, workers and peasants. It also saw the active participation of leaders, namely, Jayprakash Narayan, Aruna Asaf Ali and Ram Manohar Lohia and many women such as Matangini Hazra in Bengal, Kanaklata Barua in Assam and Rama Devi in Odisha.

As we think about the dramatic and visible signs of global interconnectedness in our lives today, we need to understand the phases through which this world in which we live has emerged.\n\nAll through history, human societies have become steadily more interlinked. From ancient times, travellers, traders, priests and pilgrims travelled vast distances for knowledge, opportunity and spiritual fulfilment, or to escape persecution. They carried goods, money, values, skills, ideas, inventions, and even germs and diseases. As early as 3000 BCE an active coastal trade linked the Indus valley civilisations with present-day West Asia. For more than a millennia, cowries (the Hindi cowdi or seashells, used as a form of currency) from the Maldives found their way to China and East Africa. The long-distance spread of disease-carrying germs may be traced as far back as the seventh century. By the thirteenth century it had become an unmistakable link.\n\n![](images/646ed7f0dd8c09a97cb410ed3583394a5cd8df1bc7d31fad2aef805c21a84255.jpg)\n\n![](images/57fc9a7053dafb4974c33df83bd121b173e9cadae5894ef5acb0a50b2ea021eb.jpg)  \n1066CH03   \nFig. 1 \u2013 Image of a ship on a memorial stone, Goa Museum, tenth century CE.\n\nFrom the ninth century, images of ships appear regularly in memorial stones found in the western coast, indicating the significance of oceanic trade.", "response": "In Chapter 3 - The Making of a Global World > 1 The Pre-modern World, the text discusses: When we talk of \u2018globalisation\u2019 we often refer to an economic system that has emerged since the last 50 years or so.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding 2.1 A World Economy Takes Shape.", "context": "A good place to start is the changing pattern of food production and consumption in industrial Europe. Traditionally, countries liked to be self-sufficient in food. But in nineteenth-century Britain, self-sufficiency in food meant lower living standards and social conflict. Why was this so?\n\nPopulation growth from the late eighteenth century had increased the demand for food grains in Britain. As urban centres expanded and industry grew, the demand for agricultural products went up, pushing up food grain prices. Under pressure from landed groups, the government also restricted the import of corn. The laws allowing the government to do this were commonly known as the \u2018Corn Laws\u2019. Unhappy with high food prices, industrialists and urban dwellers forced the abolition of the Corn Laws.\n\nAfter the Corn Laws were scrapped, food could be imported into Britain more cheaply than it could be produced within the country. British agriculture was unable to compete with imports. Vast areas of land were now left uncultivated, and thousands of men and women were thrown out of work. They flocked to the cities or migrated overseas.\n\nAs food prices fell, consumption in Britain rose. From the midnineteenth century, faster industrial growth in Britain also led to higher incomes, and therefore more food imports. Around the world \u2013 in Eastern Europe, Russia, America and Australia \u2013 lands were cleared and food production expanded to meet the British demand.\n\nIt was not enough merely to clear lands for agriculture. Railways were needed to link the agricultural regions to the ports. New harbours had to be built and old ones expanded to ship the new cargoes. People had to settle on the lands to bring them under cultivation. This meant building homes and settlements. All these activities in turn required capital and labour. Capital flowed from financial centres such as London. The demand for labour in places where labour was in short supply \u2013 as in America and Australia \u2013 led to more migration.\n\nNearly 50 million people emigrated from Europe to America and Australia in the nineteenth century. All over the world some 150 million are estimated to have left their homes, crossed oceans and vast distances over land in search of a better future.\n\n![](images/e31f0d4571510bc36e0fba2ce846c5b0fde7be555ce17df21df2db79050c5140.jpg)  \nFig. 6 \u2013 Emigrant ship leaving for the US, by M.W.

Food no longer came from a nearby village or town, but from thousands of miles away. It was not grown by a peasant tilling his own land, but by an agricultural worker, perhaps recently arrived, who was now working on a large farm that only a generation ago had most likely been a forest.

One of the oldest livestock markets in London was at Smithfield. In the midnineteenth century a huge poultry and meat market was established near the railway line connecting Smithfield to all the meat-supplying centres of the country.\n\nThe trade in meat offers a good example of this connected process. Till the 1870s, animals were shipped live from America to Europe and then slaughtered when they arrived there. But live animals took up a lot of ship space. Many also died in voyage, fell ill, lost weight, or became unfit to eat. Meat was hence an expensive luxury beyond the reach of the European poor. High prices in turn kept demand and production down until the development of a new technology, namely, refrigerated ships, which enabled the transport of perishable foods over long distances.\n\nNow animals were slaughtered for food at the starting point \u2013 in America, Australia or New Zealand \u2013 and then transported to Europe as frozen meat. This reduced shipping costs and lowered meat prices in Europe. The poor in Europe could now consume a more varied diet.

This is a good example of the widespread European imperial impact on colonised societies. It shows how in this era of conquest even a disease affecting cattle reshaped the lives and fortunes of thousands of people and their relations with the rest of the world.\n\nHistorically, Africa had abundant land and a relatively small population. For centuries, land and livestock sustained African livelihoods and people rarely worked for a wage. In latenineteenth-century Africa there were few consumer goods that wages could buy. If you had been an African possessing land and livestock \u2013 and there was plenty of both \u2013 you too would have seen little reason to work for a wage.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, Europeans were attracted to Africa due to its vast resources of land and minerals.

Entering Africa in the east, rinderpest moved west \u2018like forest fire\u2019, reaching Africa\u2019s Atlantic coast in 1892. It reached the Cape (Africa\u2019s southernmost tip) five years later. Along the way rinderpest killed 90 per cent of the cattle.\n\nThe loss of cattle destroyed African livelihoods. Planters, mine owners and colonial governments now successfully monopolised what scarce cattle resources remained, to strengthen their power and to force Africans into the labour market.

Notably for our concerns in this chapter, it plunged the first half of the twentieth century into a crisis that took over three decades to overcome. During this period the world experienced widespread economic and political instability, and another catastrophic war.\n\n### 3.1 Wartime Transformations\n\nThe First World War, as you know, was fought between two power blocs. On the one side were the Allies \u2013 Britain, France and Russia (later joined by the US); and on the opposite side were the Central Powers \u2013 Germany, Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Turkey. When the war began in August 1914, many governments thought it would be over by Christmas. It lasted more than four years.\n\nThe First World War was a war like no other before. The fighting involved the world\u2019s leading industrial nations which now harnessed the vast powers of modern industry to inflict the greatest possible destruction on their enemies.\n\nThis war was thus the first modern industrial war. It saw the use of machine guns, tanks, aircraft, chemical weapons, etc. on a massive scale. These were all increasingly products of modern large-\n\nscale industry. To fight the war, millions of soldiers had to be recruited from around the world and moved to the frontlines on large ships and trains. The scale of death and destruction \u2013 9 million dead and 20 million injured \u2013 was unthinkable before the industrial age, without the use of industrial arms.\n\nMost of the killed and maimed were men of working age. These deaths and injuries reduced the able-bodied workforce in Europe. With fewer numbers within the family, household incomes declined after the war.\n\nDuring the war, industries were restructured to produce war-related goods. Entire societies were also reorganised for war \u2013 as men went to battle, women stepped in to undertake jobs that earlier only men were expected to do.\n\n![](images/0ee66997054799c6dba6e9c4c6edb061aa155ae6b883f74b2da7fb7dda1f34d8.jpg)  \nFig. 20 \u2013 Workers in a munition factory during the First World War. Production of armaments increased rapidly to meet war demands.\n\nThe war led to the snapping of economic links between some of the world\u2019s largest economic powers which were now fighting each other to pay for them. So Britain borrowed large sums of money from US banks as well as the US public. Thus the war transformed the US from being an international debtor to an international creditor.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding 3.2 Post-war Recovery.", "context": "Post-war economic recovery proved difficult. Britain, which was the world\u2019s leading economy in the pre-war period, in particular faced a prolonged crisis. While Britain was preoccupied with war, industries had developed in India and Japan. After the war Britain found it difficult to recapture its earlier position of dominance in the Indian market, and to compete with Japan internationally. Moreover, to finance war expenditures Britain had borrowed liberally from the US. This meant that at the end of the war Britain was burdened with huge external debts.\n\nThe war had led to an economic boom, that is, to a large increase in demand, production and employment. When the war boom ended, production contracted and unemployment increased. At the same time the government reduced bloated war expenditures to bring them into line with peacetime revenues. These developments led to huge job losses \u2013 in 1921 one in every five British workers was out of work. Indeed, anxiety and uncertainty about work became an enduring part of the post-war scenario.\n\nMany agricultural economies were also in crisis. Consider the case of wheat producers. Before the war, eastern Europe was a major supplier of wheat in the world market. When this supply was disrupted during the war, wheat production in Canada, America and Australia expanded dramatically. But once the war was over, production in eastern Europe revived and created a glut in wheat output.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding 3.3 Rise of Mass Production and Consumption.", "context": "In the US, recovery was quicker. We have already seen how the war helped boost the US economy. After a short period of economic\n\ntrouble in the years after the war, the US economy resumed its strong growth in the early 1920s.\n\nOne important feature of the US economy of the 1920s was mass production. The move towards mass production had begun in the late nineteenth century, but in the 1920s it became a characteristic feature of industrial production in the US. A well-known pioneer of mass production was the car manufacturer Henry Ford. He adapted the assembly line of a Chicago slaughterhouse (in which slaughtered animals were picked apart by butchers as they came down a conveyor belt) to his new car plant in Detroit. He realised that the \u2018assembly line\u2019 method would allow a faster and cheaper way of producing vehicles. The assembly line forced workers to repeat a single task mechanically and continuously \u2013 such as fitting a particular part to the car \u2013 at a pace dictated by the\n\nconveyor belt. This was a way of increasing the output per worker by speeding up the pace of work. Standing in front of a conveyor belt no worker could afford to delay the motions, take a break, or even have a friendly word with a workmate. As a result, Henry Ford\u2019s cars came off the assembly line at three-minute intervals, a speed much faster than that achieved by previous methods. The T-Model Ford was the world\u2019s first mass-produced car.\n\nAt first workers at the Ford factory were unable to cope with the stress of working on assembly lines in which they could not control the pace of work. So they quit in large numbers. In desperation Ford doubled the daily wage to $\\$ 5$ in January 1914. At the same time he banned trade unions from operating in his plants.\n\nHenry Ford recovered the high wage by repeatedly speeding up the production line and forcing workers to work ever harder. So much so, he would soon describe his decision to double the daily wage as the \u2018best cost-cutting decision\u2019 he had ever made.\n\nFordist industrial practices soon spread in the US. They were also widely copied in Europe in the 1920s. Mass production lowered costs and prices of engineered goods. Thanks to higher wages, more workers could now afford to purchase durable consumer goods such as cars. Car production in the US rose from 2 million in 1919 to more than 5 million in 1929. Similarly, there was a spurt in the purchase of refrigerators, washing machines, radios, gramophone players, all through a system of \u2018hire purchase\u2019 (i.e., on\n\n![](images/03c34614371feeb25bfbe8fae11ba4946f52b29807ab1b9b46b5bec45daa63bf.jpg)  \nFig. 21 \u2013 T-Model automobiles lined up outside the factory.\n\ncredit repaid in weekly or monthly instalments).

During this period most parts of the world experienced catastrophic declines in production, employment, incomes and trade. The exact timing and impact of the depression varied across countries.

This was because the fall in agricultural prices was greater and more prolonged than that in the prices of industrial goods.\n\nThe depression was caused by a combination of several factors. We have already seen how fragile the post-war world economy was. First: agricultural overproduction remained a problem. This was made worse by falling agricultural prices. As prices slumped and agricultural incomes declined, farmers tried to expand production and bring a larger volume of produce to the market to maintain their overall income. This worsened the glut in the market, pushing down prices even further. Farm produce rotted for a lack of buyers.\n\nSecond: in the mid-1920s, many countries financed their investments through loans from the US.

A year later it was one quarter of that amount. Countries that depended crucially on US loans now faced an acute crisis.\n\nThe withdrawal of US loans affected much of the rest of the world, though in different ways. In Europe it led to the failure of some major banks and the collapse of currencies such as the British pound sterling. In Latin America and elsewhere it intensified the slump in agricultural and raw material prices. The US attempt to protect its economy in the depression by doubling import duties also dealt another severe blow to world trade.\n\nThe US was also the industrial country most severely affected by the depression. With the fall in prices and the prospect of a depression, US banks had also slashed domestic lending and called back loans. Farms could not sell their harvests, households were ruined, and businesses collapsed. Faced with falling incomes, many households in the US could not repay what they had borrowed, and were forced to give up their homes, cars and other consumer durables. The consumerist prosperity of the 1920s now disappeared in a puff of dust. As unemployment soared, people trudged long distances looking for any work they could find. Ultimately, the US banking system itself collapsed. Unable to recover investments, collect loans and repay depositors, thousands of banks went bankrupt and were forced to close. The numbers are phenomenal: by 1933 over 4,000 banks had closed and between 1929 and 1932 about 110, 000 companies had collapsed.\n\nBy 1935, a modest economic recovery was under way in most industrial countries.

The tremors of a crisis in one part of the world were quickly relayed to other parts, affecting lives, economies and societies worldwide.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, as you have seen, colonial India had become an exporter of agricultural goods and importer of manufactures. The depression immediately affected Indian trade. India\u2019s exports\n\n![](images/17b9f05a2a8a6ae0391fc91843c76fd99d436c505beb928edb3f23b5dd4e4a10.jpg)  \nFig. 23 \u2013 People lining up for unemployment benefits, US, photograph by Dorothea Lange, 1938. Courtesy: Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division. When an unemployment census showed 10 million people out of work, the local government in many US states began making small allowances to the unemployed. These long queues came to symbolise the poverty and unemployment of the depression years.\n\nand imports nearly halved between 1928 and 1934. As international prices crashed, prices in India also plunged. Between 1928 and 1934, wheat prices in India fell by 50 per cent.\n\nPeasants and farmers suffered more than urban dwellers. Though agricultural prices fell sharply, the colonial government refused to reduce revenue demands. Peasants producing for the world market were the worst hit.\n\nConsider the jute producers of Bengal. They grew raw jute that was processed in factories for export in the form of gunny bags. But as gunny exports collapsed, the price of raw jute crashed more than 60 per cent. Peasants who borrowed in the hope of better times or to increase output in the hope of higher incomes faced ever lower prices, and fell deeper and deeper into debt. Thus the Bengal jute growers\u2019 lament:\n\ngrow more jute, brothers, with the hope of greater cash.\n\nCosts and debts of jute will make your hopes get dashed.\n\nWhen you have spent all your money and got the crop off the ground,\n\n\u2026 traders, sitting at home, will pay only Rs 5 a maund.\n\nAcross India, peasants\u2019 indebtedness increased. They used up their savings, mortgaged lands, and sold whatever jewellery and precious metals they had to meet their expenses. In these depression years, India became an exporter of precious metals, notably gold. The famous economist John Maynard Keynes thought that Indian gold exports promoted global economic recovery. They certainly helped speed up Britain\u2019s recovery, but did little for the Indian peasant. Rural India was thus seething with unrest when Mahatma Gandhi launched the civil disobedience movement at the height of the depression in 1931.\n\nThe depression proved less grim for urban India. Because of falling prices, those with fixed incomes \u2013 say town-dwelling landowners who received rents and middle-class salaried employees \u2013 now found themselves better off. Everything cost less. Industrial investment also grew as the government extended tariff protection to industries, under the pressure of nationalist opinion.", "response": "In Chapter 3 - The Making of a Global World > Box 3 > 3.5 India and the Great Depression, the text discusses: If we look at the impact of the depression on India we realise how integrated the global economy had become by the early twentieth century.

It was a war waged for six years on many fronts, in many places, over land, on sea, in the air.\n\nOnce again death and destruction was enormous. At least 60 million people, or about 3 per cent of the world\u2019s 1939 population, are believed to have been killed, directly or indirectly, as a result of the war. Millions more were injured.\n\nUnlike in earlier wars, most of these deaths took place outside the battlefields. Many more civilians than soldiers died from war-related causes. Vast parts of Europe and Asia were devastated, and several cities were destroyed by aerial bombardment or relentless artillery attacks. The war caused an immense amount of economic devastation and social disruption. Reconstruction promised to be long and difficult.\n\n![](images/f63d1d2489c762e25fa9bb77ec7245ea73fcbe3a68fda27b092be854dd2d8026.jpg)  \nFig. 24 \u2013 German forces attack Russia, July 1941.

First, an industrial society based on mass production cannot be sustained without mass consumption. But to ensure mass consumption, there was a need for high and stable incomes. Incomes could not be stable if employment was unstable. Thus stable incomes also required steady, full employment.\n\nBut markets alone could not guarantee full employment. Therefore governments would have to step in to minimise\n\nfluctuations of price, output and employment. Economic stability could be ensured only through the intervention of the government.\n\nThe second lesson related to a country\u2019s economic links with the outside world. The goal of full employment could only be achieved if governments had power to control flows of goods, capital and labour.\n\nThus in brief, the main aim of the post-war international economic system was to preserve economic stability and full employment in the industrial world. Its framework was agreed upon at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference held in July 1944 at Bretton Woods in New Hampshire, USA.\n\nThe Bretton Woods conference established the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to deal with external surpluses and deficits of its member nations. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (popularly known as the World Bank) was set up to finance postwar reconstruction. The IMF and the World Bank are referred to as the Bretton Woods institutions or sometimes the Bretton Woods twins. The post-war international economic system is also often described as the Bretton Woods system.\n\nThe IMF and the World Bank commenced financial operations in 1947. Decision-making in these institutions is controlled by the Western industrial powers. The US has an effective right of veto over key IMF and World Bank decisions.\n\nThe international monetary system is the system linking national currencies and monetary system. The Bretton Woods system was based on fixed exchange rates. In this system, national currencies, for example the Indian rupee, were pegged to the dollar at a fixed exchange rate. The dollar itself was anchored to gold at a fixed price of $\\$ 35$ per ounce of gold.", "response": "In Chapter 3 - The Making of a Global World > 4 Rebuilding a World Economy: The Post-war Era > 4.1 Post-war Settlement and the Bretton Woods Institutions, the text discusses: Economists and politicians drew two key lessons from inter-war economic experiences.

When we talk of industrial production we refer to factory production. When we talk of industrial workers we mean factory workers. Histories of industrialisation very often begin with the setting up of the first factories.\n\nThere is a problem with such ideas. Even before factories began to dot the landscape in England and Europe, there was large-scale industrial production for an international market. This was not based on factories. Many historians now refer to this phase of industrialisation as proto-industrialisation.\n\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, merchants from the towns in Europe began moving to the countryside, supplying money to peasants and artisans, persuading them to produce for an international market. With the expansion of world trade and the acquisition of colonies in different parts of the world, the demand for goods began growing. But merchants could not expand production within towns. This was because here urban crafts and trade guilds were powerful. These were associations of producers that trained craftspeople, maintained control over production, regulated competition and prices, and restricted the entry of new people into\n\nthe trade. Rulers granted different guilds the monopoly right to produce and trade in specific products. It was therefore difficult for new merchants to set up business in towns. So they turned to the countryside.\n\nIn the countryside poor peasants and artisans began working for merchants. As you have seen in the textbook last year, this was a time when open fields were disappearing and commons were being enclosed. Cottagers and poor peasants who had earlier depended on common lands for their survival, gathering their firewood, berries, vegetables, hay and straw, had to now look for alternative sources of income. Many had tiny plots of land which could not provide work for all members of the household. So when merchants came around and offered advances to produce goods for them, peasant households eagerly agreed.

Can you see any difference in the way the two images show industrialisation? Explain your view briefly.\n\nSecond: the new industries could not easily displace traditional industries. Even at the end of the nineteenth century, less than 20 per cent of the total workforce was employed in technologically advanced industrial sectors. Textiles was a dynamic sector, but a large portion of the output was produced not within factories, but outside, within domestic units.\n\nThird: the pace of change in the \u2018traditional\u2019 industries was not set by steam-powered cotton or metal industries, but they did not remain entirely stagnant either. Seemingly ordinary and small innovations were the basis of growth in many non-mechanised sectors such as food processing, building, pottery, glass work, tanning, furniture making, and production of implements.\n\nFourth: technological changes occurred slowly. They did not spread dramatically across the industrial landscape. New technology was expensive and merchants and industrialists were cautious about using it. The machines often broke down and repair was costly. They were not as effective as their inventors and manufacturers claimed.\n\nConsider the case of the steam engine. James Watt improved the steam engine produced by Newcomen and patented the new engine in 1781. His industrialist friend Mathew Boulton manufactured the new model. But for years he could find no buyers. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, there were no more than 321 steam engines\n\nall over England. Of these, 80 were\n\nin cotton industries, nine in wool industries, and the rest in mining, canal works and iron works.

Once again we will look not only at factory industries but also at the non-mechanised sector.

Coarser cottons were produced in many countries, but the finer varieties often came from India. Armenian and Persian merchants took the goods from Punjab to Afghanistan, eastern Persia and Central Asia. Bales of fine textiles were carried on camel back via the north-west frontier, through mountain passes and across deserts. A vibrant sea trade operated through the main pre-colonial ports. Surat on the Gujarat coast connected India to the Gulf and Red Sea Ports; Masulipatam on the Coromandel coast and Hoogly in Bengal had trade links with Southeast Asian ports.\n\nA variety of Indian merchants and bankers were involved in this network of export trade \u2013 financing production, carrying goods and supplying exporters. Supply merchants linked the port towns to the inland regions. They gave advances to weavers, procured the woven cloth from weaving villages, and carried the supply to the ports. At the port, the big shippers and export merchants had brokers who negotiated the price and bought goods from the supply merchants operating inland.\n\nBy the 1750s this network, controlled by Indian merchants, was breaking down.\n\nThe European companies gradually gained power \u2013 first securing a variety of concessions from local courts, then the monopoly rights to trade. This resulted in a decline of the old ports of Surat and Hoogly through which local merchants had operated.

So the company was keen on expanding textile exports from India.\n\nBefore establishing political power in Bengal and Carnatic in the 1760s and 1770s, the East India Company had found it difficult to ensure a regular supply of goods for export. The French, Dutch,\n\n![](images/c87d6c4707ea8450e79371118e29c4256661fffeddc0a4c70f136d3786215e39.jpg)  \nFig. 14 \u2013 A weaver at work, Gujarat.\n\nPortuguese as well as the local traders competed in the market to secure woven cloth. So the weaver and supply merchants could bargain and try selling the produce to the best buyer. In their letters back to London, Company officials continuously complained of difficulties of supply and the high prices.\n\nHowever, once the East India Company established political power, it could assert a monopoly right to trade. It proceeded to develop a system of management and control that would eliminate competition, control costs, and ensure regular supplies of cotton and silk goods. This it did through a series of steps.\n\nFirst: the Company tried to eliminate the existing traders and brokers connected with the cloth trade, and establish a more direct control over the weaver. It appointed a paid servant called the gomastha to supervise weavers, collect supplies, and examine the quality of cloth.\n\nSecond: it prevented Company weavers from dealing with other buyers. One way of doing this was through the system of advances. Once an order was placed, the weavers were given loans to purchase the raw material for their production. Those who took loans had to hand over the cloth they produced to the gomastha. They could not take it to any other trader.\n\nAs loans flowed in and the demand for fine textiles expanded, weavers eagerly took the advances, hoping to earn more. Many weavers had small plots of land which they had earlier cultivated along with weaving, and the produce from this took care of their family needs. Now they had to lease out the land and devote all their time to weaving. Weaving, in fact, required the labour of the entire family, with children and women all engaged in different stages of the process.\n\nSoon, however, in many weaving villages there were reports of clashes between weavers and gomasthas. Earlier supply merchants had very often lived within the weaving villages, and had a close relationship with the weavers, looking after their needs and helping them in times of crisis. The new gomasthas were outsiders, with no long-term social link with the village. They acted arrogantly, marched into villages with sepoys and peons, and punished weavers for delays in supply \u2013 often beating and flogging them.

What were its implications?\n\nAs cotton industries developed in England, industrial groups began worrying about imports from other countries. They pressurised the government to impose import duties on cotton textiles so that Manchester goods could sell in Britain without facing any competition from outside. At the same time industrialists persuaded the East India Company to sell British manufactures in Indian markets as well. Exports of British cotton goods increased dramatically in the early nineteenth century. At the end of the eighteenth century there had been virtually no import of cotton piece-goods into India. But by 1850 cotton piece-goods constituted over 31 per cent of the value of Indian imports; and by the 1870s this figure was over 50 per cent.\n\nCotton weavers in India thus faced two problems at the same time: their export market collapsed, and the local market shrank, being glutted with Manchester imports.

Let us see who they were.\n\nThe history of many business groups goes back to trade with China. From the late eighteenth century, as you have read in your book last year, the British in India began exporting opium to China and took tea from China to England. Many Indians became junior players in this trade, providing finance, procuring supplies, and shipping consignments. Having earned through trade, some of these businessmen had visions of developing industrial enterprises in India. In Bengal, Dwarkanath Tagore made his fortune in the China trade before he turned to industrial investment, setting up six joint-stock companies in the 1830s and 1840s. Tagore\u2019s enterprises sank along with those of others in the wider business crises of the 1840s, but later in the nineteenth century many of the China traders became successful industrialists. In Bombay, Parsis like Dinshaw Petit and Jamsetjee Nusserwanjee Tata who built huge industrial empires in India, accumulated their initial wealth partly from exports to China, and partly from raw cotton shipments to England. Seth Hukumchand, a Marwari businessman who set up the first Indian jute mill in Calcutta in 1917, also traded with China. So did the father as well as grandfather of the famous industrialist G.D.

They operated within India, carrying goods from one place to another, banking money, transferring funds between cities, and financing traders. When opportunities of investment in industries opened up, many of them set up factories.\n\nAs colonial control over Indian trade tightened, the space within which Indian merchants could function became increasingly limited. They were barred from trading with Europe in manufactured goods, and had to export mostly raw materials and food grains \u2013 raw cotton, opium, wheat and indigo \u2013 required by the British. They were also gradually edged out of the shipping business.\n\nTill the First World War, European Managing Agencies in fact controlled a large sector of Indian industries.

Peasants and artisans who found no work in the village went to the industrial centres in search of work. Over 50 per cent workers in the Bombay cotton industries in 1911 came from the neighbouring district of Ratnagiri, while the mills of Kanpur got most of their textile hands from the villages within the district of Kanpur. Most often millworkers moved between the village and the city, returning to their village homes during harvests and festivals.\n\nOver time, as news of employment spread, workers travelled great distances in the hope of work in the mills. From the United Provinces, for instance, they went to work in the textile mills of Bombay and in the jute mills of Calcutta.\n\n![](images/389bd6697ca3a9beb1d0702d468744aed8e255b2233ce7f306e2ba91788857a4.jpg)  \nFig. 19 \u2013 Young workers of a Bombay mill, early twentieth century.

They established tea and coffee plantations, acquiring land at cheap rates from the colonial government; and they invested in mining, indigo and jute. Most of these were products required primarily for export trade and not for sale in India.\n\nWhen Indian businessmen began setting up industries in the late nineteenth century, they avoided competing with Manchester goods in the Indian market. Since yarn was not an important part of British imports into India, the early cotton mills in India produced coarse cotton yarn (thread) rather than fabric. When yarn was imported it was only of the superior variety. The yarn produced in Indian spinning mills was used by handloom weavers in India or exported to China.\n\nBy the first decade of the twentieth century a series of changes affected the pattern of industrialisation. As the swadeshi movement gathered momentum, nationalists mobilised people to boycott foreign cloth. Industrial groups organised themselves to protect their collective interests, pressurising the government to increase tariff protection and grant other concessions. From 1906, moreover, the export of Indian yarn to China declined since produce from Chinese and\n\nJapanese mills flooded the Chinese market. So industrialists in India began shifting from yarn to cloth production. Cotton piecegoods production in India doubled between 1900 and 1912.\n\nYet, till the First World War, industrial growth was slow. The war created a dramatically new situation. With British mills busy with war production to meet the needs of the army, Manchester imports into India declined. Suddenly, Indian mills had a vast home market to supply. As the war prolonged, Indian factories were called upon to supply war needs: jute bags, cloth for army uniforms, tents and leather boots, horse and mule saddles and a host of other items. New factories were set up and old\n\n![](images/c225d380d2b64e52726e8154980466b9b52241783f5f8e4a688fae31c4bee07c.jpg)  \nFig. 22 \u2013 The first office of the Madras Chamber of Commerce.

Over the war years industrial production boomed.\n\nAfter the war, Manchester could never recapture its old position in the Indian market.

Most of them \u2013 about 67 per cent in 1911 \u2013 were located in Bengal and Bombay. Over the rest of the country, small-scale production continued to predominate. Only a small proportion of the total industrial labour force worked in registered factories: 5 per cent in 1911 and 10 per cent in 1931. The rest worked in small workshops and household units, often located in alleys and bylanes, invisible to the passer-by.\n\nIn fact, in some instances, handicrafts production actually expanded in the twentieth century. This is true even in the case of the handloom sector that we have discussed. While cheap machine-made thread wiped out the spinning industry in the nineteenth century, the weavers survived, despite problems. In the twentieth century, handloom cloth production expanded steadily: almost trebling between 1900 and 1940.\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nThis was partly because of technological changes. Handicrafts people adopt new technology if that helps them improve production without excessively pushing up costs. So, by the second decade of the twentieth century we find weavers using looms with a fly shuttle. This increased productivity per worker, speeded up production and reduced labour demand. By 1941, over 35 per cent of handlooms in India were fitted with fly shuttles: in regions like Travancore, Madras, Mysore, Cochin, Bengal the proportion was 70 to 80 per cent. There were several other small innovations that helped weavers improve their productivity and compete with the mill sector.\n\n![](images/cef6c5056fc3fbaa6acb9aaef73cee97716a7d9ca00c59828da4bad8fd702ad8.jpg)  \nFig. 23 \u2013 A Hand-woven Cloth.\n\nThe intricate designs of hand-woven cloth could not be easily copied by the mills.", "response": "In chapter 4 - The Age of Industrialisation > 5 The Peculiarities of Industrial Growth > 5.1 Small-scale Industries Predominate, the text discusses: While factory industries grew steadily after the war, large industries formed only a small segment of the economy.

They have to feel like using the product. How was this done?\n\nOne way in which new consumers are created is through advertisements.

They appear in newspapers, magazines, hoardings, street walls, television screens. But if we look back into history we find that from the very beginning of the industrial age, advertisements have played a part in expanding the markets for products, and in shaping a new consumer culture.\n\nWhen Manchester industrialists began selling cloth in India, they put labels on the cloth bundles. The label was needed to make the place of manufacture and the name of the company familiar to the buyer. The label was also to be a mark of quality.

The imprinted image of Krishna or Saraswati was also intended to make the manufacture from a foreign land appear somewhat familiar to Indian people.\n\nBy the late nineteenth century, manufacturers were printing calendars to popularise their products.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding 2 Print Comes to Europe.", "context": "For centuries, silk and spices from China flowed into Europe through the silk route. In the eleventh century, Chinese paper reached Europe via the same route. Paper made possible the production of manuscripts, carefully written by scribes. Then, in 1295, Marco Polo, a great explorer, returned to Italy after many years of exploration in China. As you read above, China already had the technology of woodblock printing. Marco Polo brought this knowledge back with him. Now Italians began producing books with woodblocks, and soon the technology spread to other parts of Europe. Luxury editions were still handwritten on very expensive vellum, meant for aristocratic circles and rich monastic libraries which scoffed at printed books as cheap vulgarities. Merchants and students in the university towns bought the cheaper printed copies.\n\nAs the demand for books increased, booksellers all over Europe began exporting books to many different countries. Book fairs were held at different places. Production of handwritten manuscripts was also organised in new ways to meet the expanded demand. Scribes or skilled handwriters were no longer solely employed by wealthy or influential patrons but increasingly by booksellers as well. More than 50 scribes often worked for one bookseller.\n\nBut the production of handwritten manuscripts could not satisfy the ever-increasing demand for books. Copying was an expensive, laborious and time-consuming business. Manuscripts were fragile, awkward to handle, and could not be carried around or read easily. Their circulation therefore remained limited. With the growing demand for books, woodblock printing gradually became more and more popular. By the early fifteenth century, woodblocks were being widely used in Europe to print textiles, playing cards, and religious pictures with simple, brief texts.\n\nThere was clearly a great need for even quicker and cheaper reproduction of texts. This could only be with the invention of a new print technology. The breakthrough occurred at Strasbourg, Germany, where Johann Gutenberg developed the first-known printing press in the 1430s.", "response": "In chapter 5 - Print Culture and the Modern World > 2 Print Comes to Europe, the text discusses: For centuries, silk and spices from China flowed into Europe through the silk route.

Write a letter from China to describe the world of print which you have seen there.\n\n### 2.1 Gutenberg and the Printing Press\n\nGutenberg was the son of a merchant and grew up on a large agricultural estate. From his childhood he had seen wine and olive presses. Subsequently, he learnt the art of polishing stones, became a master goldsmith, and also acquired the expertise to create lead moulds used for making trinkets. Drawing on this knowledge, Gutenberg adapted existing technology to design his innovation. The olive press provided the model for the printing press, and moulds were used for casting the metal types for the letters of the alphabet. By 1448, Gutenberg perfected the system. The first book he printed was the Bible. About 180 copies were printed and it took three years to produce them. By the standards of the time this was fast production.\n\nThe new technology did not entirely displace the existing art of producing books by hand.\n\nIn fact, printed books at first closely resembled the written manuscripts in appearance and layout. The metal letters imitated the ornamental handwritten styles. Borders were illuminated by hand with foliage and other patterns, and illustrations were painted. In the books printed for the rich, space for decoration was kept blank on the printed page. Each purchaser could choose the design and decide on the painting school that would do the illustrations.\n\nIn the hundred years between 1450 and 1550, printing presses were set up in most countries of Europe. Printers from Germany travelled to other countries, seeking work and helping start new presses. As the number of printing presses grew, book production boomed. The second half of the fifteenth century saw 20 million copies of printed books flooding the markets in Europe. The number went up in the sixteenth century to about 200 million copies.\n\nThis shift from hand printing to mechanical printing led to the print revolution.", "response": "This activity involves: Imagine that you are Marco Polo.

The Gutenberg press could print 250 sheets on one side per hour.\n\n![](images/aa6bd6d8a76a46e38f434a2f35401479792e59548899546050f70c99c6c5aa00.jpg)  \nFig. 7 \u2013 Pages of Gutenberg\u2019s Bible, the first printed book in Europe.\n\nGutenberg printed about 180 copies, of which no more than 50 have survived.\n\nLook at these pages of Gutenberg\u2019s Bible carefully. They were not just products of new technology. The text was printed in the new Gutenberg press with metal type, but the borders were carefully designed, painted and illuminated by hand by artists. No two copies were the same. Every page of each copy was different. Even when two copies look similar, a careful comparison will reveal differences. Elites everywhere preferred this lack of uniformity: what they possessed then could be claimed as unique, for no one else owned a copy that was exactly the same.\n\nIn the text you will notice the use of colour within the letters in various places. This had two functions: it added colour to the page, and highlighted all the holy words to emphasise their significance. But the colour on every page of the text was added by hand. Gutenberg printed the text in black, leaving spaces where the colour could be filled in later.\n\n![](images/c16790410797b250b7c62d3ddb42cd53aea5f34b4624093b30fb52ab36994e34.jpg)  \nFig. 8 \u2013 A printer\u2019s workshop, sixteenth century.\n\nThis picture depicts what a printer\u2019s shop looked like in the sixteenth century.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding 3 The Print Revolution and Its Impact.", "context": "What was the print revolution? It was not just a development, a new way of producing books; it transformed the lives of people, changing their relationship to information and knowledge, and with institutions and authorities. It influenced popular perceptions and opened up new ways of looking at things.\n\nLet us explore some of these changes.\n\n### 3.1 A New Reading Public\n\nWith the printing press, a new reading public emerged. Printing reduced the cost of books. The time and labour required to produce each book came down, and multiple copies could be produced with greater ease. Books flooded the market, reaching out to an ever-growing readership.\n\nAccess to books created a new culture of reading. Earlier, reading was restricted to the elites. Common people lived in a world of oral culture. They heard sacred texts read out, ballads recited, and folk tales narrated. Knowledge was transferred orally. People collectively heard a story, or saw a performance. As you will see in Chapter 8, they did not read a book individually and silently. Before the age of print, books were not only expensive but they could not be produced in sufficient numbers. Now books could reach out to wider sections of people. If earlier there was a hearing public, now a reading public came into being.\n\nBut the transition was not so simple. Books could be read only by the literate, and the rates of literacy in most European countries were very low till the twentieth century. How, then, could publishers persuade the common people to welcome the printed book? To do this, they had to keep in mind the wider reach of the printed work: even those who did not read could certainly enjoy listening to books being read out. So printers began publishing popular ballads and folk tales, and such books would be profusely illustrated with pictures. These were then sung and recited at gatherings in villages and in taverns in towns.\n\nOral culture thus entered print and printed material was orally transmitted. The line that separated the oral and reading cultures became blurred. And the hearing public and reading public became intermingled.", "response": "In chapter 5 - Print Culture and the Modern World > 3 The Print Revolution and Its Impact, the text discusses: What was the print revolution?

Even those who disagreed with established authorities could now print and circulate their ideas. Through the printed message, they could persuade people to think differently, and move them to action. This had significance in different spheres of life.\n\nNot everyone welcomed the printed book, and those who did also had fears about it. Many were apprehensive of the effects that the easier access to the printed word and the wider circulation of books, could have on people\u2019s minds. It was feared that if there was no control over what was printed and read then rebellious and irreligious thoughts might spread. If that happened the authority of \u2018valuable\u2019 literature would be destroyed. Expressed by religious authorities and monarchs, as well as many writers and artists, this anxiety was the basis of widespread criticism of the new printed literature that had begun to circulate.\n\nLet us consider the implication of this in one sphere of life in early modern Europe \u2013 namely, religion.\n\nIn 1517, the religious reformer Martin Luther wrote Ninety Five Theses criticising many of the practices and rituals of the Roman Catholic Church. A printed\n\ncopy of this was posted on a church door in Wittenberg. It challenged the Church to debate his ideas. Luther\u2019s writings were immediately reproduced in vast numbers and read widely. This lead to a division within the Church and to the beginning of the Protestant\n\nReformation. Luther\u2019s translation of the New Testament sold 5,000 copies within a few weeks and a second edition appeared within three months. Deeply grateful to print, Luther said, \u2018Printing is the ultimate gift of God and the greatest one.\u2019 Several scholars, in fact, think that print brought about a new intellectual atmosphere and helped spread the new ideas that led to the Reformation.\n\nFig. 9 \u2013 J.V.

Churches of different denominations set up schools in villages, carrying literacy to peasants and artisans. By the end of the eighteenth century, in some parts of Europe literacy rates were as high as 60 to 80 per cent. As literacy and schools spread in European countries, there was a virtual reading mania. People wanted books to read and printers produced books in everincreasing numbers.\n\nNew forms of popular literature appeared in print, targeting new audiences. Booksellers employed pedlars who roamed around villages, carrying little books for sale. There were almanacs or ritual calendars, along with ballads and folktales. But other forms of reading matter, largely for entertainment, began to reach ordinary readers as well. In England, penny chapbooks were carried by petty pedlars known as chapmen, and sold for a penny, so that even the poor could buy them. In France, were the \u201cBiliotheque Bleue\u201d, which were low-priced small books printed on poor quality paper, and bound in cheap blue covers. Then there were the romances, printed on four to six pages, and the more substantial \u2018histories\u2019 which were stories about the past. Books were of various sizes, serving many different purposes and interests.\n\nThe periodical press developed from the early eighteenth century, combining information about current affairs with entertainment. Newspapers and journals carried information about wars and trade, as well as news of developments in other places.\n\nSimilarly, the ideas of scientists and philosophers now became more accessible to the common people. Ancient and medieval scientific texts were compiled and published, and maps and scientific diagrams were widely printed. When scientists like Isaac Newton began to publish their discoveries, they could influence a much wider circle of scientifically minded readers.

Production of school textbooks became critical for the publishing industry. A children\u2019s press, devoted to literature for children alone, was set up in France in 1857. This press published new works as well as old fairy tales and folk tales. The Grimm Brothers in Germany spent years compiling traditional folk tales gathered from peasants. What they collected was edited before the stories were published in a collection in 1812. Anything that was considered unsuitable for children or would appear vulgar to the elites, was not included in the published version. Rural folk tales thus acquired a new form. In this way, print recorded old tales but also changed them.\n\nWomen became important as readers as well as writers. Penny magazines (see Fig. 12) were especially meant for women, as were manuals teaching proper behaviour and housekeeping. When novels began to be written in the nineteenth century, women were seen as important readers. Some of the best-\n\nknown novelists were women: Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters, George Eliot. Their writings became important in defining a new type of woman: a person with will, strength of personality, determination and the power to think.\n\nLending libraries had been in existence from the seventeenth century onwards. In the nineteenth century, lending libraries in England became instruments for educating white-collar workers, artisans and lower-middle-class people.

They wrote political tracts and autobiographies in large numbers.\n\n![](images/e181ce2e06eb7f896a304ccb6a1397604d9c95d851cf0d21b8d1053cad053c4c.jpg)  \nFig. 12 \u2013 Frontispiece of Penny Magazine.

Through the nineteenth century, there were a series of further innovations in printing technology. By the mid-nineteenth century, Richard M. Hoe of New York had perfected the power-driven cylindrical press. This was capable of printing 8,000 sheets per hour. This press was particularly useful for printing newspapers. In the late nineteenth century, the offset press was developed which could print up to six colours at a time. From the turn of the twentieth century, electrically operated presses accelerated printing operations. A series of other developments followed. Methods of feeding paper improved, the quality of plates became better, automatic paper reels and photoelectric controls of the colour register were introduced. The accumulation of several individual mechanical improvements transformed the appearance of printed texts.\n\nPrinters and publishers continuously developed new strategies to sell their product. Nineteenth-century periodicals serialised important novels, which gave birth to a particular way of writing novels. In the 1920s in England, popular works were sold in cheap series, called the Shilling Series. The dust cover or the book jacket is also a twentieth-century innovation.

Different groups confronted the changes happening within colonial society in different ways, and offered a variety of new interpretations of the beliefs of different religions. Some criticised existing practices and campaigned for reform, while others countered the arguments of reformers. These debates were carried out in public and in print. Printed tracts and newspapers not only spread the new ideas, but they shaped the nature of the debate. A wider public could now participate in these public discussions and express their views. New ideas emerged through these clashes of opinions.\n\nThis was a time of intense controversies between social and religious reformers and the Hindu orthodoxy over matters like widow immolation, monotheism, Brahmanical priesthood and idolatry. In Bengal, as the debate developed, tracts and newspapers proliferated, circulating a variety of arguments. To reach a wider audience, the ideas were printed in the everyday, spoken language of ordinary people. Rammohun Roy published the Sambad Kaumudi from 1821 and the Hindu orthodoxy commissioned the Samachar Chandrika to oppose his opinions. From 1822, two Persian newspapers were published, Jam-i-Jahan Nama and Shamsul Akhbar. In the same year, a Gujarati newspaper, the Bombay Samachar, made its appearance.\n\nIn north India, the ulama were deeply anxious about the collapse of Muslim dynasties. They feared that colonial rulers would encourage conversion, change the Muslim personal laws. To counter this, they used cheap lithographic presses, published Persian and Urdu translations of holy scriptures, and printed religious newspapers and tracts. The Deoband Seminary, founded in 1867, published thousands upon thousands of fatwas telling Muslim readers how to conduct themselves in their everyday lives, and explaining the meanings of Islamic doctrines. All through the nineteenth century, a number of Muslim sects and seminaries appeared, each with a different interpretation of faith, each keen on enlarging its following and countering the influence of its opponents.

The novel, a literary firm which had developed in Europe, ideally catered to this need. It soon acquired distinctively Indian forms and styles. For readers, it opened up new worlds of experience, and gave a vivid sense of the diversity of human lives.\n\nOther new literary forms also entered the world of reading \u2013 lyrics, short stories, essays about social and political matters. In different ways, they reinforced the new emphasis on human lives and intimate feelings, about the political and social rules that shaped such things.\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, a new visual culture was taking shape. With the setting up of an increasing number of printing presses, visual images could be easily reproduced in multiple copies. Painters like Raja Ravi Varma produced images for mass circulation. Poor wood engravers who made woodblocks set up shop near the letterpresses, and were employed by print shops. Cheap prints and calendars, easily available in the bazaar, could be bought even by the poor to decorate the walls of their homes or places of work. These prints began shaping popular ideas about modernity and tradition, religion and politics, and society and culture.\n\nBy the 1870s, caricatures and cartoons were being published in journals and newspapers, commenting on social and political issues.

Women\u2019s reading, therefore, increased enormously in middle-class homes. Liberal husbands and fathers began educating their womenfolk at home, and sent them to schools when women\u2019s schools were set up in the cities and towns after the mid-nineteenth century. Many journals began carrying writings by women, and explained why women should be educated. They also carried a syllabus and attached suitable reading matter which could be used for home-based schooling.\n\nBut not all families were liberal. Conservative Hindus believed that a literate girl would be widowed and Muslims feared that educated women would be corrupted by reading Urdu romances. Sometimes, rebel women defied such prohibition. We know the story of a girl in a conservative Muslim family of north India who secretly learnt to read and write in Urdu. Her family wanted her to read only the Arabic Quran which she did not understand. So she insisted on learning to read a language that was her own. In East Bengal, in the early nineteenth century, Rashsundari Debi, a young married girl in a very orthodox household, learnt to read in the secrecy of her kitchen. Later, she wrote her autobiography Amar Jiban which was published in 1876. It was the first full-length autobiography published in the Bengali language.\n\nSince social reforms and novels had already created a great interest in women\u2019s lives and emotions, there was also an interest in what women would have to say about their own lives. From the 1860s, a few Bengali women like Kailashbashini Debi wrote books highlighting the experiences of women \u2013 about how women were imprisoned at home, kept in ignorance, forced to do hard domestic labour and treated unjustly by the very people they served. In the 1880s, in present-day Maharashtra, Tarabai Shinde and Pandita Ramabai wrote with passionate anger about the miserable lives of upper-caste Hindu women, especially widows. A woman in a Tamil novel expressed what reading meant to women who were so greatly confined by social regulations: \u2018For various reasons, my world is small \u2026 More than half my life\u2019s happiness has come from books \u2026\u2019\n\nWhile Urdu, Tamil, Bengali and Marathi print culture had developed early, Hindi printing began seriously only from the 1870s.

Strangely, its early measures to control printed matter were directed against Englishmen in India who were critical of Company misrule and hated the actions of particular Company officers. The Company was worried that such criticisms might be used by its critics in England to attack its trade monopoly in India.\n\nBy the 1820s, the Calcutta Supreme Court passed certain regulations to control press freedom and the Company began encouraging publication of newspapers that would celebrate Britsh rule. In 1835, faced with urgent petitions by editors of English and vernacular newspapers, Governor-General Bentinck agreed to revise press laws. Thomas Macaulay, a liberal colonial official, formulated new rules that restored the earlier freedoms.\n\nAfter the revolt of 1857, the attitude to freedom of the press changed. Enraged Englishmen demanded a clamp down on the \u2018native\u2019 press. As vernacular newspapers became assertively nationalist, the colonial government began debating measures of stringent control. In 1878, the Vernacular Press Act was passed, modelled on the Irish Press Laws. It provided the government with extensive rights to censor reports and editorials in the vernacular press. From now on the government kept regular track of the vernacular newspapers published in different provinces. When a report was judged as seditious, the newspaper was warned, and if the warning was ignored, the press was liable to be seized and the printing machinery confiscated.\n\nDespite repressive measures, nationalist newspapers grew in numbers in all parts of India. They reported on colonial misrule and encouraged nationalist activities. Attempts to throttle nationalist criticism provoked militant protest. This in turn led to a renewed cycle of persecution and protests. When Punjab revolutionaries were deported in 1907, Balgangadhar Tilak wrote with great sympathy about them in his Kesari.

We continue our discussion on real numbers in this chapter. We begin with two very important properties of positive integers in Sections 1.2 and 1.3, namely the Euclid\u2019s division algorithm and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\n\nEuclid\u2019s division algorithm, as the name suggests, has to do with divisibility of integers. Stated simply, it says any positive integer a can be divided by another positive integer $b$ in such a way that it leaves a remainder r that is smaller than $b$ . Many of you probably recognise this as the usual long division process. Although this result is quite easy to state and understand, it has many applications related to the divisibility properties of integers. We touch upon a few of them, and use it mainly to compute the HCF of two positive integers.\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, on the other hand, has to do something with multiplication of positive integers. You already know that every composite number can be expressed as a product of primes in a unique way \u2014 this important fact is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Again, while it is a result that is easy to state and understand, it has some very deep and significant applications in the field of mathematics. We use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic for two main applications. First, we use it to prove the irrationality of many of the numbers you studied in Class IX, such as ${ \\sqrt { 2 } } , { \\sqrt { 3 } }$ and $\\sqrt { 5 }$ . Second, we apply this theorem to explore when exactly the decimal expansion of a rational number, say ${ \\frac { p } { q } } ( q \\neq 0 )$ , is terminating and when it is non-terminating repeating. We do so by looking at the prime factorisation of the denominator $q$ of $\\frac { p } { q }$ .

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding 1.2 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.", "context": "In your earlier classes, you have seen that any natural number can be written as a product of its prime factors. For instance, $2 = 2$ , $4 = 2 \\times 2$ , $2 5 3 = 1 1 \\times 2 3$ , and so on. Now, let us try and look at natural numbers from the other direction. That is, can any natural number be obtained by multiplying prime numbers? Let us see.\n\nTake any collection of prime numbers, say 2, 3, 7, 11 and 23. If we multiply some or all of these numbers, allowing them to repeat as many times as we wish, we can produce a large collection of positive integers (In fact, infinitely many). Let us list a few :\n\n$$\n7 \\times 1 1 \\times 2 3 = 1 7 7 1 \\quad 3 \\times 7 \\times 1 1 \\times 2 3 = 5 3 1 3\n$$\n\n$$\n2 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 1 1 \\times 2 3 = 1 0 6 2 6 2 ^ {3} \\times 3 \\times 7 ^ {3} = 8 2 3 2\n$$\n\n$$\n2 ^ {2} \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 1 1 \\times 2 3 = 2 1 2 5 2\n$$\n\nand so on.\n\nNow, let us suppose your collection of primes includes all the possible primes. What is your guess about the size of this collection? Does it contain only a finite number of integers,\n\nor infinitely many? Infact, there are infinitely many primes. So, if we combine all these primes in all possible ways, we will get an infinite collection of numbers, all the primes and all possible products of primes. The question is \u2013 can we produce all the composite numbers this way? What do you think? Do you think that there may be a composite number which is not the product of powers of primes? Before we answer this, let us factorise positive integers, that is, do the opposite of what we have done so far.\n\nWe are going to use the factor tree with which you are all familiar. Let us take some large number, say, 32760, and factorise it as shown.\n\n![](images/77bb9cb9fefeecfeb22c8035a9834bb5123de29862cad66d63b84c3fedd2ef93.jpg)", "response": "In cHAPTER 1 - REAL NUMBERS > 1.2 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, the text discusses: In your earlier classes, you have seen that any natural number can be written as a product of its prime factors.

Let us try another number, say, 123 456789. This can be written as $3 ^ { 2 } \\times 3 8 0 3 \\times 3 6 0 7$ . Of course, you have to check that 3803 and 3607 are primes! (Try it out for several other natural numbers yourself.) This leads us to a conjecture that every composite number can be written as the product of powers of primes. In fact, this statement is true, and is called the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic because of its basic crucial importance to the study of integers. Let us now formally state this theorem.\n\nTheorem 1.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) : Every composite number can be expressed (factorised) as a product of primes, and this factorisation is unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur.\n\nAn equivalent version of Theorem 1.2 was probably first recorded as Proposition 14 of Book IX in Euclid\u2019s Elements, before it came to be known as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. However, the first correct proof was given by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae.\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss is often referred to as the \u2018Prince of Mathematicians\u2019 and is considered one of the three greatest mathematicians of all time, along with Archimedes and Newton. He has made fundamental contributions to both mathematics and science.\n\n![](images/6b969ad52c0da15c624b65d10e4992b90e214f001e2a10419f9253253aa03516.jpg)  \nCarl Friedrich Gauss (1777 \u2013 1855)\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says that every composite number can be factorised as a product of primes. Actually it says more. It says that given any composite number it can be factorised as a product of prime numbers in a \u2018unique\u2019 way, except for the order in which the primes occur. That is, given any composite number there is one and only one way to write it as a product of primes, as long as we are not particular about the order in which the primes occur. So, for example, we regard $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7$ as the same as $3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 2$ , or any other possible order in which these primes are written.

If we combine the same primes, we will get powers of primes. For example,\n\n$$\n3 2 7 6 0 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 1 3 = 2 ^ {3} \\times 3 ^ {2} \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 1 3\n$$\n\nOnce we have decided that the order will be ascending, then the way the number is factorised, is unique.\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic has many applications, both within mathematics and in other fields. Let us look at some examples.\n\nExample 1 : Consider the numbers $4 ^ { n }$ , where $n$ is a natural number. Check whether there is any value of $n$ for which $4 ^ { n }$ ends with the digit zero.\n\nSolution : If the number $4 ^ { n }$ , for any $n$ , were to end with the digit zero, then it would be divisible by 5. That is, the prime factorisation of $4 ^ { n }$ would contain the prime 5. This is not possible because $4 ^ { n } = ( 2 ) ^ { 2 n }$ ; so the only prime in the factorisation of $4 ^ { n }$ is 2. So, the uniqueness of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic guarantees that there are no other primes in the factorisation of $4 ^ { n }$ . So, there is no natural number $n$ for which $4 ^ { n }$ ends with the digit zero.\n\nYou have already learnt how to find the HCF and LCM of two positive integers using the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic in earlier classes, without realising it!

This number, in the expanded notation is $1 0 y + x$ (for example, when 56 is reversed, we get $6 5 =$ $1 0 ( 6 ) + 5 )$ .\n\nAccording to the given condition.\n\n$$\n(1 0 x + y) + (1 0 y + x) = 6 6\n$$\n\ni.e.,\n\ni.e., (1)\n\nWe are also given that the digits differ by 2, therefore,\n\neither (2)\n\nor (3)\n\nIf $\\dot { \\mathbf { \\eta } } _ { x - y } = 2$ , then solving (1) and (2) by elimination, we get $x = 4$ and $y = 2$ . In this case, we get the number 42.\n\n$\\operatorname { I f } y - x = 2$ , then solving (1) and (3) by elimination, we get $x = 2$ and $y = 4$ .\n\nIn this case, we get the number 24.\n\nThus, there are two such numbers 42 and 24.\n\nVerification : Here $4 2 + 2 4 = 6 6$ and $4 - 2 = 2$ .

One type was the quadratic polynomial of the form $a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c .$ , $a \\neq 0$ . When we equate this polynomial to zero, we get a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations come up when we deal with many real-life situations.\n\nFor instance, suppose a charity trust decides to build a prayer hall having a carpet area of 300 square metres with its length one metre more than twice its breadth. What should be the length and breadth of the hall? Suppose the breadth of the hall is $x$ metres. Then, its length should be $( 2 x + 1 )$ metres. We can depict this information pictorially as shown in Fig. 4.1.\n\n![](images/724a8b3c7e530d7ffd56620333f12c1970e33ea69257d9d54e234432d4230b15.jpg)  \nFig. 4.1\n\nNow, area of the hall $= ( 2 x + 1 )$ . $x \\ : \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } = ( 2 x ^ { 2 } + x ) \\ : \\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$\n\nSo, $2 x ^ { 2 } + x = 3 0 0$ (Given)\n\nTherefore, $2 x ^ { 2 } + x - 3 0 0 = 0$\n\nSo, the breadth of the hall should satisfy the equation $2 x ^ { 2 } + x - 3 0 0 = 0$ which is a quadratic equation.\n\nMany people believe that Babylonians were the first to solve quadratic equations. For instance, they knew how to find two positive numbers with a given positive sum and a given positive product, and this problem is equivalent to solving a quadratic equation of the form $x ^ { 2 } - p x + q = 0$ . Greek mathematician Euclid developed a geometrical approach for finding out lengths which, in our present day terminology, are solutions of quadratic equations. Solving of quadratic equations, in general form, is often credited to ancient Indian mathematicians. In fact, Brahmagupta (C.E.598\u2013665) gave an explicit formula to solve a quadratic equation of the form $a x ^ { 2 } + b x = c$ . Later,\n\nSridharacharya (C.E. 1025) derived a formula, now known as the quadratic formula, (as quoted by Bhaskara II) for solving a quadratic equation by the method of completing the square. An Arab mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (about C.E. 800) also studied quadratic equations of different types. Abraham bar Hiyya Ha-Nasi, i n his book \u2018Liber embadorum\u2019 published in Europe in C.E. 1145 gave complete solutions of different quadratic equations.\n\nIn this chapter, you will study quadratic equations, and various ways of finding their roots.

If so, how will you write it? Perhaps by following a pattern or rule. Let us observe and write the rule.\n\nIn (i), each term is 1 more than the term preceding it.\n\nIn (ii), each term is 30 less than the term preceding it.\n\nIn (iii), each term is obtained by adding 1 to the term preceding it.\n\nIn (iv), all the terms in the list are 3 , i.e., each term is obtained by adding (or subtracting) 0 to the term preceding it.   \nIn (v), each term is obtained by adding \u2013 0.5 to (i.e., subtracting 0.5 from) the term preceding it.\n\nIn all the lists above, we see that successive terms are obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding terms. Such list of numbers is said to form an Arithmetic Progression ( AP ).\n\nSo, an arithmetic progression is a list of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding term except the first term.\n\nThis fixed number is called the common difference of the AP. Remember that it can be positive, negative or zero.\n\nLet us denote the first term of an AP by $a _ { _ 1 }$ , second term by a2, . . ., nth term by $a _ { _ n }$ and the common difference by $d .$ .

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding 6.2 Similar Figures.", "context": "In Class IX, you have seen that all circles with the same radii are congruent, all squares with the same side lengths are congruent and all equilateral triangles with the same side lengths are congruent.\n\nNow consider any two (or more) circles [see Fig. 6.1 (i)]. Are they congruent? Since all of them do not have the same radius, they are not congruent to each other. Note that some are congruent and some are not, but all of them have the same shape. So they all are, what we call, similar. Two similar figures have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. Therefore, all circles are similar. What about two (or more) squares or two (or more) equilateral triangles [see Fig. 6.1 (ii) and (iii)]? As observed in the case of circles, here also all squares are similar and all equilateral triangles are similar.\n\nFrom the above, we can say that all congruent figures are similar but the similar figures need not be congruent.\n\nCan a circle and a square be similar?

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding 6.2 Similar Figures.", "context": "What does the photographer do when she prints photographs of different sizes from the same negative? You must have heard about the stamp size, passport size and postcard size photographs. She generally takes a photograph on a small size film, say of 35mm size and then enlarges it into a bigger size, say 45mm (or $5 5 \\mathrm { m m } )$ ). Thus, if we consider any line segment in the smaller photograph (figure), its corresponding line segment in the bigger photograph (figure) will be ${ \\frac { 4 5 } { 3 5 } } \\left( \\operatorname { o r } { \\frac { 5 5 } { 3 5 } } \\right)$ of that of the line segment. This really means that every line segment of the smaller photograph is enlarged (increased) in the ratio 35:45 (or 35:55). It can also be said that every line segment of the bigger photograph is reduced (decreased) in the ratio 45:35 (or 55:35). Further, if you consider inclinations (or angles) between any pair of corresponding line segments in the two photographs of different sizes, you shall see that these inclinations(or angles) are always equal. This is the essence of the similarity of two figures and in particular of two polygons. We say that:\n\nTwo polygons of the same number of sides are similar, $i f ( i )$ their corresponding angles are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion).\n\nNote that the same ratio of the corresponding sides is referred to as the scale factor (or the Representative Fraction) for the polygons. You must have heard that world maps (i.e., global maps) and blue prints for the construction of a building are prepared using a suitable scale factor and observing certain conventions.\n\nIn order to understand similarity of figures more clearly, let us perform the following activity:\n\nActivity 1 : Place a lighted bulb at a point O on the ceiling and directly below it a table in your classroom. Let us cut a polygon, say a quadrilateral ABCD, from a plane cardboard and place this cardboard parallel to the ground between the lighted bulb and the table. Then a shadow of ABCD is cast on the table. Mark the outline of this shadow as $\\mathrm { { A ^ { \\prime } B ^ { \\prime } C ^ { \\prime } D ^ { \\prime } } }$ (see Fig.6.4).\n\nNote that the quadrilateral $\\mathrm { { A ^ { \\prime } B ^ { \\prime } C ^ { \\prime } D ^ { \\prime } } }$ is an enlargement (or magnification) of the quadrilateral ABCD. This is because of the property of light that light propogates in a straight line.

The distance of a point from the y-axis is called its $\\mathbf { \\nabla } _ { \\mathbf { x } } .$ -coordinate, or abscissa. The distance of a point from the $x$ -axis is called its y-coordinate, or ordinate. The coordinates of a point on the $x$ -axis are of the form $( x , 0 )$ , and of a point on the y-axis are of the form $( 0 , y )$ .\n\nHere is a play for you. Draw a set of a pair of perpendicular axes on a graph paper. Now plot the following points and join them as directed: Join the point A(4, 8) to B(3, 9) to C(3, 8) to $\\mathrm { D } ( 1 , 6 )$ to $\\operatorname { E } ( 1 , 5 )$ to F(3, 3) to G(6, 3) to H(8, 5) to I(8, 6) to J(6, 8) to K(6, 9) to L(5, 8) to A.

What picture have you got?\n\nAlso, you have seen that a linear equation in two variables of the form $a x + b y + c = 0 .$ , $( a , b$ are not simultaneously zero), when represented graphically, gives a straight line. Further, in Chapter 2, you have seen the graph of $y = a x ^ { 2 } + b x + c \\left( a \\neq 0 \\right)$ , is a parabola. In fact, coordinate geometry has been developed as an algebraic tool for studying geometry of figures. It helps us to study geometry using algebra, and understand algebra with the help of geometry. Because of this, coordinate geometry is widely applied in various fields such as physics, engineering, navigation, seismology and art!\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn how to find the distance between the two points whose coordinates are given, and to find the area of the triangle formed by three given points.

This seems an extremely sensible guess, and one can check that if $n = 5$ , we do get 16 regions. So, having verified this formula for 5 points, are you satisfied that for any $n$ points there are $2 ^ { n - 1 }$ regions? If so, how would you respond, if someone asked you, how you can be sure about this for $n = 2 5$ , say? To deal with such questions, you would need a proof which shows beyond doubt that this result is true, or a counter-example to show that this result fails for some $\\overrightarrow { \\mathbf { \\nabla } n } \\overrightarrow { \\mathbf { \\nabla } }$ . Actually, if you are patient and try it out for $n = 6$ , you will find that there are 31 regions, and for $n = 7$ there are 57 regions. So, $n =$ 6, is a counter-example to the conjecture above. This demonstrates the power of a counterexample. You may recall that in the Class IX we discussed that to disprove a statement, it is enough to come up with a single counter-example.\n\nYou may have noticed that we insisted on a proof regarding the number of regions in spite of verifying the result for $n = 1$ , 2, 3, 4 and 5.

To establish its validity, it is not enough to verify the result for $n = 1 , 2 , 3$ and so on, because there may be some $ { { ^ \\circ } n \\mathrm { \\ ' } }$ for which this result is not true (just as in the example above, the result failed for $n = 6$ ).

That is, $\\displaystyle { \\sim } p , \\sim q , \\sim r , \\sim s$ and ${ \\sim } t$ are negations of the statements $p , q , r , s$ and $t$ , respectively. Here, ${ \\sim } p$ is read as \u2018not $p '$ . The statement ${ \\sim } p$ negates the assertion that the statement $p$ makes. Notice that in our usual talk we would simply mean ${ \\sim } p$ as \u2018It did not rain in Delhi on 1 September 2005.\u2019 However, we need to be careful while doing so. You might think that one can obtain the negation of a statement by simply inserting the word \u2018not\u2019 in the given statement at a suitable place. While this works in the case of $p$ , the difficulty comes when we have a statement that begins with \u2018all\u2019. Consider, for example, the statement $q$ : All teachers are female. We said the negation of this statement is ${ \\sim } q$ : It is false that all teachers are female.

We obtain the statement: \u2018All teachers are not female\u2019, or we can obtain the statement: \u2018Not all teachers are female.\u2019 The first statement can confuse people. It could imply (if we lay emphasis on the word \u2018All\u2019) that all teachers are male! This is certainly not the negation of $q$ .

We now explore \u2018indirect\u2019 arguments, in particular, a very powerful tool in mathematics known as \u2018proof by contradiction\u2019. We have already used this method in Chapter 1 to establish the irrationality of several numbers and also in other chapters to prove some theorems. Here, we do several more examples to illustrate the idea.\n\nBefore we proceed, let us explain what a contradiction is. In mathematics, a contradiction occurs when we get a statement $p$ such that $p$ is true and ${ \\sim } p$ , its negation, is also true. For example,\n\np: $x = \\frac { a } { b }$ , where $a$ and $b$ are coprime.\n\nq: 2 divides both $ { { ^ \\circ } } a ^ { \\prime }$ and $^ { \\circ } b ^ { \\prime }$ .\n\nIf we assume that $p$ is true and also manage to show that $q$ is true, then we have arrived at a contradiction, because $q$ implies that the negation of $\\dot { p }$ is true. If you remember, this is exactly what happened when we tried to prove that $\\sqrt { 2 }$ is irrational (see Chapter 1).\n\nHow does proof by contradiction work? Let us see this through a specific example.\n\nSuppose we are given the following :\n\nAll women are mortal. A is a woman. Prove that A is mortal.\n\nEven though this is a rather easy example, let us see how we can prove this by contradiction.\n\nl Let us assume that we want to establish the truth of a statement $p$ (here we want to show that $p \\colon ^ { \\bullet } \\mathbf { A }$ is mortal\u2019 is true).\n\nl So, we begin by assuming that the statement is not true, that is, we assume that the negation of $p$ is true (i.e., A is not mortal).   \nWe then proceed to carry out a series of logical deductions based on the truth of the negation of $p$ . (Since A is not mortal, we have a counter-example to the statement \u2018All women are mortal.\u2019 Hence, it is false that all women are mortal.)   \nIf this leads to a contradiction, then the contradiction arises because of our faulty assumption that $p$ is not true. (We have a contradiction, since we have shown that the statement \u2018All women are mortal\u2019 and its negation, \u2018Not all women are mortal\u2019 is true at the same time. This contradiction arose, because we assumed that A is not mortal.)   \nl Therefore, our assumption is wrong, i.e., $p$ has to be true.

(See Fig. 8.5)\n\nThe first use of the idea of \u2018sine\u2019 in the way we use it today was in the work Aryabhatiyam by Aryabhata, in A.D. 500. Aryabhata used the word ardha-jya for the half-chord, which was shortened to jya or jiva in due course. When the Aryabhatiyam was translated into Arabic, the word jiva was retained as it is. The word jiva was translated into sinus, which means curve, when the Arabic version was translated into Latin. Soon the word sinus, also used as sine, became common in mathematical texts throughout Europe. An English Professor of astronomy Edmund Gunter (1581\u2013 1626), first used the abbreviated notation \u2018sin\u2019.\n\n![](images/c2ba839ab25e6ed3af63a1288e60c852454f297be6fa38caff641a4f239bdcf4.jpg)  \nAryabhata C.E. 476 \u2013 550\n\nThe origin of the terms \u2018cosine\u2019 and \u2018tangent\u2019 was much later. The cosine function arose from the need to compute the sine of the complementary angle. Aryabhatta called it kotijya. The name cosinus originated with Edmund Gunter. In 1674, the English Mathematician Sir Jonas Moore first used the abbreviated notation \u2018cos\u2019.\n\nRemark : Note that the symbol sin A is used as an abbreviation for \u2018the sine of the angle A\u2019. sin A is not the product of \u2018sin\u2019 and A. \u2018sin\u2019 separated from A has no meaning. Similarly, cos A is not the product of \u2018cos\u2019 and A. Similar interpretations follow for other trigonometric ratios also.\n\nNow, if we take a point P on the hypotenuse AC or a point Q on AC extended, of the right triangle ABC and draw PM perpendicular to AB and QN perpendicular to AB extended (see Fig. 8.6), how will the trigonometric ratios of \u0091 A in ' PAM differ from those of \u0091 A in $\\Delta$ CAB or from those of \u0091 A in ' QAN?\n\n![](images/6a5b5a0fd23ed04e9704948ba8a738c3440ffaade0a9abecd936aee655bc364d.jpg)  \nFig. 8.6", "response": "In chapter 8 - INTRODUCTION TO TRIGONOMETRY > 8.2 Trigonometric Ratios, the text discusses: $$\n\\cot a n g e n t \\angle A = \\frac {1}{\\tan a n g e n t \\angle A} = \\frac {\\text {s i d e a d j a c e n t t o a n g l e A}}{\\text {s i d e o p p o s..."}

You have also studied various terms related to a circle like chord, segment, sector, arc etc. Let us now examine the different situations that can arise when a circle and a line are given in a plane.\n\nSo, let us consider a circle and a line PQ. There can be three possibilities given in Fig. 10.1 below:\n\n![](images/68b1939c759970a43fd7a7f48295aff9e0ef67442676975687c2a77e69fc41af.jpg)  \n(i\n\n![](images/acd1b8ccb34f1aca963a7426fb3a6a1f004d67d6485ac2dee92f25ccc85f8a84.jpg)  \n(ii)\n\n![](images/a8eab30fa37a227c7ba6a44b6d595b5de059fbee2a90e3a990243d3b32a13c2b.jpg)  \n  \nFig. 10.1\n\nIn Fig. 10.1 (i), the line PQ and the circle have no common point. In this case, PQ is called a non-intersecting line with respect to the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (ii), there are two common points A and B that the line PQ and the circle have. In this case, we call the line PQ a secant of the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (iii), there is only one point A which is common to the line PQ and the circle. In this case, the line is called a tangent to the circle.\n\nYou might have seen a pulley fitted over a well which is used in taking out water from the well. Look at Fig. 10.2. Here the rope on both sides of the pulley, if considered as a ray, is like a tangent to the circle representing the pulley.\n\nIs there any position of the line with respect to the circle other than the types given above? You can see that there cannot be any other type of position of the line with respect to the circle.

Put the system on a table and gently rotate the wire AB about the point P to get different positions of the straight wire [see Fig. 10.3(i)].\n\nIn various positions, the wire intersects the circular wire at P and at another point $\\mathrm { Q } _ { \\mathrm { l } }$ or $\\mathrm { Q } _ { 2 }$ or $\\mathrm { Q } _ { 3 }$ , etc. In one position, you will see that it will intersect the circle at the point P only (see position $\\mathrm { A ^ { \\prime } B ^ { \\prime } }$ of AB). This shows that a tangent exists at the point P of the circle. On rotating further, you can observe that in all other positions of AB, it will intersect the circle at P and at another point, say $\\mathrm { R } _ { 1 }$ or $\\mathsf { R } _ { 2 }$ or $\\mathrm { R } _ { 3 }$ , etc. So, you can observe that there is only one tangent at a point of the circle.\n\n![](images/16435db1ce4135fbe9bb118b862237f907668276a7415bcc03277b5e8b2b4d2f.jpg)  \nFig. 10.3 (i)\n\nWhile doing activity above, you must have observed that as the position AB moves towards the position $\\mathbf A ^ { \\prime } \\mathbf B ^ { \\prime }$ , the common point, say $\\mathrm { Q } _ { \\mathrm { l } }$ , of the line AB and the circle gradually comes nearer and nearer to the common point P.

How do we find the surface area of such a solid? Now, whenever we come across a new problem, we first try to see, if we can break it down into smaller problems, we have earlier solved. We can see that this solid is made up of a cylinder with two hemispheres stuck at either end. It would look like what we have in Fig. 12.4, after we put the pieces all together.\n\n![](images/74c1b059b85374ea4954878a9d464a70def9f67d9579e746023622d9de7dde57.jpg)  \nFig. 12.4\n\nIf we consider the surface of the newly formed object, we would be able to see only the curved surfaces of the two hemispheres and the curved surface of the cylinder.\n\nSo, the total surface area of the new solid is the sum of the curved surface areas of each of the individual parts. This gives,\n\nTSA of new solid $=$ CSA of one hemisphere $^ +$ CSA of cylinder\n\n$+ \\mathrm { C S A }$ of other hemisphere\n\nwhere TSA, CSA stand for \u2018Total Surface Area\u2019 and \u2018Curved Surface Area\u2019 respectively.\n\nLet us now consider another situation. Suppose we are making a toy by putting together a hemisphere and a cone. Let us see the steps that we would be going through.\n\nFirst, we would take a cone and a hemisphere and bring their flat faces together. Here, of course, we would take the base radius of the cone equal to the radius of the hemisphere, for the toy is to have a smooth surface. So, the steps would be as shown in Fig. 12.5.\n\n![](images/a3c361508da5e815989be6a35b42750389ef67c3bfe19cfafbff9ebe659f8ceb.jpg)  \nFig. 12.5\n\nAt the end of our trial, we have got ourselves a nice round-bottomed toy.

So, we need to convert given ungrouped data into grouped data and devise some method to find its mean.\n\nLet us convert the ungrouped data of Example 1 into grouped data by forming class-intervals of width, say 15. Remember that, while allocating frequencies to each class-interval, students falling in any upper class-limit would be considered in the next class, e.g., 4 students who have obtained 40 marks would be considered in the class-interval 40-55 and not in 25-40. With this convention in our mind, let us form a grouped frequency distribution table (see Table 13.2).\n\nTable 13.2   \n\n<table><tr><td>Class interval</td><td>10 - 25</td><td>25 - 40</td><td>40 - 55</td><td>55 - 70</td><td>70 - 85</td><td>85 - 100</td></tr><tr><td>Number of students</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr></table>\n\nNow, for each class-interval, we require a point which would serve as the representative of the whole class. It is assumed that the frequency of each class-interval is centred around its mid-point. So the mid-point (or class mark) of each class can be chosen to represent the observations falling in the class.

Can you think why this is so, and which one is more accurate? The difference in the two values is because of the mid-point assumption in Table 13.3, 59.3 being the exact mean, while 62 an approximate mean.\n\nSometimes when the numerical values of $x _ { i }$ and $f _ { i }$ are large, finding the product of $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } } _ { i }$ and f becomes tedious and time consuming. So, for such situations, let us think of a method of reducing these calculations.\n\nWe can do nothing with the $f _ { i } ^ { \\phantom { } ^ { \\dagger } } \\mathbf { S } _ { \\mathrm { i } }$ , but we can change each $x _ { i }$ to a smaller number so that our calculations become easy. How do we do this? What about subtracting a fixed number from each of these $x _ { \\ i } ^ { \\phantom { } } \\mathrm { s } _ { \\mathrm { } } ^ { \\dagger }$ Let us try this method.\n\nThe first step is to choose one among the $x _ { i } ^ { \\mathrm { ' } } \\mathbf { S }$ as the assumed mean, and denote it by $ { { ^ \\circ } } a ^ { \\prime }$ . Also, to further reduce our calculation work, we may take $ { { ^ \\circ } } _ { a } .$ to be that $x _ { i }$ which lies in the centre of $x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } , . . . . , x _ { n }$ . So, we can choose $a = 4 7 . 5$ or $a = 6 2 . 5$ . Let us choose $a = 4 7 . 5$ .\n\nThe next step is to find the difference $d _ { i }$ between $a$ and each of the x \u2019s, that is, the deviation of $ { { ^ \\circ } } a ^ { \\prime }$ from each of the $x _ { _ i }$ \u2019s.\n\ni.e., $d _ { i } = x _ { i } - a = x _ { i } - 4 7 . 5$\n\nThe third step is to find the product of $d _ { i }$ with the corresponding $f _ { i } ,$ and take the sum of all the $f _ { i }$ $d _ { i }$ \u2019s.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding 13.4 Median of Grouped Data.", "context": "How many students have scored less than 20 marks? Observe that the number of students who have scored less than 20 include the number of students who have scored marks from 0 - 10 as well as the number of students who have scored marks from 10 - 20. So, the total number of students with marks less than 20 is $5 + 3$ , i.e., 8. We say that the cumulative frequency of the class 10 -20 is 8.\n\nSimilarly, we can compute the cumulative frequencies of the other classes, i.e., the number of students with marks less than 30, less than 40, . . ., less than 100.

From Table 13.12, we observe that all 53 students have scored marks more than or equal to 0. Since there are 5 students scoring marks in the interval 0 - 10, this means that there are $5 3 - 5 = 4 8$ students getting more than or equal to 10 marks. Continuing in the same manner, we get the number of students scoring 20 or above as $4 8 - 3 = 4 5$ , 30 or above as $4 5 - 4 = 4 1$ , and so on, as shown in Table 13.14.\n\nTable 13.14   \n\n<table><tr><td>Marks obtained</td><td>Number of students\n(Cumulative frequency)</td></tr><tr><td>More than or equal to 0</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>More than or equal to 10</td><td>53 \u2013 5 = 48</td></tr><tr><td>More than or equal to 20</td><td>48 \u2013 3 = 45</td></tr><tr><td>More than or equal to 30</td><td>45 \u2013 4 = 41</td></tr><tr><td>More than or equal to 40</td><td>41 \u2013 3 = 38</td></tr><tr><td>More than or equal to 50</td><td>38 \u2013 3 = 35</td></tr><tr><td>More than or equal to 60</td><td>35 \u2013 4 = 31</td></tr><tr><td>More than or equal to 70</td><td>31 \u2013 7 = 24</td></tr><tr><td>More than or equal to 80</td><td>24 \u2013 9 = 15</td></tr><tr><td>More than or equal to 90</td><td>15 \u2013 7 = 8</td></tr></table>\n\nThe table above is called a cumulative frequency distribution of the more than type.

But which class should this be?\n\nTo find this class, we find the cumulative frequencies of all the classes and $\\frac { n } { 2 }$ . We now locate the class whose cumulative frequency is greater than (and nearest to) $\\frac { n } { 2 }$ \u0098 This is called the median class. In the distribution above, $n = 5 3$ .

Observe that from the given distribution, we find that there are 4 girls with height less than 140, i.e., the frequency of class interval below 140 is 4. Now, there are 11 girls with heights less than 145 and 4 girls with height less than 140. Therefore, the number of girls with height in the interval 140 - 145 is $1 1 - 4 = 7$ . Similarly, the frequency of 145 - 150 is $2 9 - 1 1 = 1 8$ , for 150 - 155, it is $4 0 - 2 9 = 1 1$ , and so on.

It also enables us to compare two or more distributions. For example, by comparing the average (mean) results of students of different schools of a particular examination, we can conclude which school has a better performance.\n\nHowever, extreme values in the data affect the mean. For example, the mean of classes having frequencies more or less the same is a good representative of the data. But, if one class has frequency, say 2, and the five others have frequency 20, 25, 20, 21, 18, then the mean will certainly not reflect the way the data behaves. So, in such cases, the mean is not a good representative of the data.\n\nIn problems where individual observations are not important, and we wish to find out a \u2018typical\u2019 observation, the median is more appropriate, e.g., finding the typical productivity rate of workers, average wage in a country, etc. These are situations where extreme values may be there.

Woodward\n\n### 14.1 Probability \u2014 A Theoretical Approach\n\nLet us consider the following situation :\n\nSuppose a coin is tossed at random.\n\nWhen we speak of a coin, we assume it to be \u2018fair\u2019, that is, it is symmetrical so that there is no reason for it to come down more often on one side than the other. We call this property of the coin as being \u2018unbiased\u2019. By the phrase \u2018random toss\u2019, we mean that the coin is allowed to fall freely without any bias or interference.\n\nWe know, in advance, that the coin can only land in one of two possible ways \u2014 either head up or tail up (we dismiss the possibility of its \u2018landing\u2019 on its edge, which may be possible, for example, if it falls on sand). We can reasonably assume that each outcome, head or tail, is as likely to occur as the other. We refer to this by saying that the outcomes head and tail, are equally likely.\n\nFor another example of equally likely outcomes, suppose we throw a die once. For us, a die will always mean a fair die. What are the possible outcomes? They are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Each number has the same possibility of showing up. So the equally likely outcomes of throwing a die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.\n\nAre the outcomes of every experiment equally likely? Let us see.\n\nSuppose that a bag contains 4 red balls and 1 blue ball, and you draw a ball without looking into the bag. What are the outcomes? Are the outcomes \u2014 a red ball and a blue ball equally likely? Since there are 4 red balls and only one blue ball, you would agree that you are more likely to get a red ball than a blue ball. So, the outcomes (a red ball or a blue ball) are not equally likely. However, the outcome of drawing a ball of any colour from the bag is equally likely. So, all experiments do not necessarily have equally likely outcomes.\n\nHowever, in this chapter, from now on, we will assume that all the experiments have equally likely outcomes.\n\nIn Class IX, we defined the experimental or empirical probability P(E) of an event E as\n\n$$\n\\mathrm {P} (\\mathrm {E}) = \\frac {\\text {N u m b e r o f t r i a l s i n w h i c h t h e e v e n t h a p p e n e d}}{\\text {T o t a l n u m b e r o f t r i a l s}}\n$$", "response": "In chapter 15 - PROBABILITY > 14, the text discusses: The theory of probabilities and the theory of errors now constitute a formidable body of great mathematical interest and of great practical importance..."}

But how about repeating the experiment of launching a satellite in order to compute the empirical probability of its failure during launching, or the repetition of the phenomenon of an earthquake to compute the empirical probability of a multi-storeyed building getting destroyed in an earthquake?\n\nIn experiments where we are prepared to make certain assumptions, the repetition of an experiment can be avoided, as the assumptions help in directly calculating the exact (theoretical) probability. The assumption of equally likely outcomes (which is valid in many experiments, as in the two examples above, of a coin and of a die) is one such assumption that leads us to the following definition of probability of an event.\n\nThe theoretical probability (also called classical probability) of an event E, written as P(E), is defined as\n\n$$\n\\mathbf {P} (\\mathbf {E}) = \\frac {\\text {N u m b e r o f o u t c o m e s f a v o u r a b l e t o E}}{\\text {N u m b e r o f a l l p o s s i b l e o u t c o m e s o f t h e e x p e r i m e n t}},\n$$\n\nwhere we assume that the outcomes of the experiment are equally likely.\n\nWe will briefly refer to theoretical probability as probability.\n\nThis definition of probability was given by Pierre Simon Laplace in 1795.\n\nProbability theory had its origin in the 16th century when an Italian physician and mathematician J.Cardan wrote the first book on the subject, The Book on Games of Chance. Since its inception, the study of probability has attracted the attention of great mathematicians. James Bernoulli (1654 \u2013 1705), A. de Moivre (1667 \u2013 1754), and Pierre Simon Laplace are among those who made significant contributions to this field. Laplace\u2019s Theorie Analytique des Probabilit\u00e9s, 1812, is considered to be the greatest contribution by a single person to the theory of probability. In recent years, probability has been used extensively in many areas such as biology, economics, genetics, physics, sociology etc.\n\n![](images/8bd2b8768523963cfaea7ce265e8d6189c7dc5cf63d97351b0890b0028b6e47a.jpg)  \nPierre Simon Laplace (1749 \u2013 1827)\n\nLet us find the probability for some of the events associated with experiments where the equally likely assumption holds.\n\nExample $1 :$ Find the probability of getting a head when a coin is tossed once.

Did they pull out the veins and arteries from some adult dead bodies and measure them? Did they drain out the blood to arrive at these results? Did they travel to the Sun with a thermometer to get the temperature of the Sun? Surely not. Then how did they get these figures?\n\nWell, the answer lies in mathematical modelling, which we introduced to you in Class IX. Recall that a mathematical model is a mathematical description of some real-life situation. Also, recall that mathematical modelling is the process of creating a mathematical model of a problem, and using it to analyse and solve the problem.\n\nSo, in mathematical modelling, we take a real-world problem and convert it to an equivalent mathematical problem. We then solve the mathematical problem, and interpret its solution in the situation of the real-world problem. And then, it is important to see that the solution, we have obtained, \u2018makes sense\u2019, which is the stage of validating the model. Some examples, where mathematical modelling is of great importance, are:\n\n(i) Finding the width and depth of a river at an unreachable place.   \n(ii) Estimating the mass of the Earth and other planets.   \n(iii) Estimating the distance between Earth and any other planet.   \n(iv) Predicting the arrrival of the monsoon in a country.\n\n(v) Predicting the trend of the stock market.   \n(vi) Estimating the volume of blood inside the body of a person.   \n(vii) Predicting the population of a city after 10 years.   \n(viii) Estimating the number of leaves in a tree.   \n(ix) Estimating the ppm of different pollutants in the atmosphere of a city.   \n(x) Estimating the effect of pollutants on the environment.   \n(xi) Estimating the temperature on the Sun\u2019s surface.\n\nIn this chapter we shall revisit the process of mathematical modelling, and take examples from the world around us to illustrate this. In Section A2.2 we take you through all the stages of building a model. In Section A2.3, we discuss a variety of examples. In Section A2.4, we look at reasons for the importance of mathematical modelling.\n\nA point to remember is that here we aim to make you aware of an important way in which mathematics helps to solve real-world problems.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding A2.2 Stages in Mathematical Modelling.", "context": "In Class IX, we considered some examples of the use of modelling. Did they give you an insight into the process and the steps involved in it? Let us quickly revisit the main steps in mathematical modelling.\n\nStep 1 (Understanding the problem) : Define the real problem, and if working in a team, discuss the issues that you wish to understand. Simplify by making assumptions and ignoring certain factors so that the problem is manageable.\n\nFor example, suppose our problem is to estimate the number of fishes in a lake. It is not possible to capture each of these fishes and count them. We could possibly capture a sample and from it try and estimate the total number of fishes in the lake.\n\nStep 2 (Mathematical description and formulation) : Describe, in mathematical terms, the different aspects of the problem. Some ways to describe the features mathematically, include:\n\nz define variables   \n$\\bullet$ write equations or inequalities   \n$\\bullet$ gather data and organise into tables   \n$\\bullet$ z make graphs   \ncalculate probabilities\n\nFor example, having taken a sample, as stated in Step 1, how do we estimate the entire population? We would have to then mark the sampled fishes, allow them to mix with the remaining ones in the lake, again draw a sample from the lake, and see how many of the previously marked ones are present in the new sample. Then, using ratio and proportion, we can come up with an estimate of the total population. For instance, let us take a sample of 20 fishes from the lake and mark them, and then release them in the same lake, so as to mix with the remaining fishes. We then take another sample (say 50), from the mixed population and see how many are marked. So, we gather our data and analyse it.\n\nOne major assumption we are making is that the marked fishes mix uniformly with the remaining fishes, and the sample we take is a good representative of the entire population.\n\nStep 3 (Solving the mathematical problem) : The simplified mathematical problem developed in Step 2 is then solved using various mathematical techniques.\n\nFor instance, suppose in the second sample in the example in Step 2, 5 fishes are marked. So, ${ \\frac { 5 } { 5 0 } } , \\mathrm { i . e . , } { \\frac { 1 } { 1 0 } } ,$ $\\frac { 5 } { 5 0 } { ; }$ , i.e., ${ \\frac { 1 } { 1 0 } } ,$ of the population is marked. If this is typical of the whole population, then $\\frac { 1 } { 1 0 }$ th of the population $= 2 0$ .\n\nSo, the whole population $= 2 0 \\times 1 0 = 2 0 0$ .\n\nStep 4 (Interpreting the solution) : The solution obtained in the previous step is now looked at, in the context of the real-life situation that we had started with in Step 1.", "response": "In chapter 15 - PROBABILITY > A2.2 Stages in Mathematical Modelling, the text discusses: In Class IX, we considered some examples of the use of modelling.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding A2.2 Stages in Mathematical Modelling.", "context": "For instance, our solution in the problem in Step 3 gives us the population of fishes as 200.\n\nStep 5 (Validating the model) : We go back to the original situation and see if the results of the mathematical work make sense. If so, we use the model until new information becomes available or assumptions change.\n\nSometimes, because of the simplification assumptions we make, we may lose essential aspects of the real problem while giving its mathematical description. In such cases, the solution could very often be off the mark, and not make sense in the real situation. If this happens, we reconsider the assumptions made in Step 1 and revise them to be more realistic, possibly by including some factors which were not considered earlier.\n\nFor instance, in Step 3 we had obtained an estimate of the entire population of fishes. It may not be the actual number of fishes in the pond. We next see whether this is a good estimate of the population by repeating Steps 2 and 3 a few times, and taking the mean of the results obtained. This would give a closer estimate of the population.\n\nAnother way of visualising the process of mathematical modelling is shown in Fig. A2.1.\n\n![](images/dd93ea0bbc4970b77c3e6ab37175803abb98342434d699d88f34cc81cf19b680.jpg)  \nFig. A2.1\n\nModellers look for a balance between simplification (for ease of solution) and accuracy. They hope to approximate reality closely enough to make some progress. The best outcome is to be able to predict what will happen, or estimate an outcome, with reasonable accuracy.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding Solution :.", "context": "Sometimes a trader introduces an instalment scheme as a marketing strategy to allure customers to purchase these articles. Under the instalment scheme, the customer is not required to make full payment of the article at the time of buying it. She/he is allowed to pay a part of it at the time of purchase, and the rest can be paid in instalments, which could be monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or even yearly. Of course, the buyer will have to pay more in the instalment plan, because the seller is going to charge some interest on account of the payment made at a later date (called deferred payment).\n\nBefore we take a few examples to understand the instalment scheme, let us understand the most frequently used terms related to this concept.\n\nThe cash price of an article is the amount which a customer has to pay as full payment of the article at the time it is purchased. Cash down payment is the amount which a customer has to pay as part payment of the price of an article at the time of purchase.\n\nRemark : If the instalment scheme is such that the remaining payment is completely made within one year of the purchase of the article, then simple interest is charged on the deferred payment.\n\nIn the past, charging interest on borrowed money was often considered evil, and, in particular, was long prohibited. One way people got around the law against paying interest was to borrow in one currency and repay in another, the interest being disguised in the exchange rate.\n\nLet us now come to a related mathematical modelling problem.\n\nExample 2 : Juhi wants to buy a bicycle.

He tells Juhi that she could take the bicycle by making a payment of ` 600 cash down and the remaining money could be made in two monthly instalments of ` 610 each.

Mathematicians and specialists in other fields share their knowledge and expertise to improve existing products, develop better ones, or predict the behaviour of certain products.\n\nThere are, of course, many specific reasons for the importance of modelling, but most are related in some ways to the following :\n\nz To gain understanding. If we have a mathematical model which reflects the essential behaviour of a real-world system of interest, we can understand that system better through an analysis of the model. Furthermore, in the process of building the model we find out which factors are most important in the system, and how the different aspects of the system are related.   \nz To predict, or forecast, or simulate. Very often, we wish to know what a real-world system will do in the future, but it is expensive, impractical or impossible to experiment directly with the system. For example, in weather prediction, to study drug efficacy in humans, finding an optimum design of a nuclear reactor, and so on.\n\nForecasting is very important in many types of organisations, since predictions of future events have to be incorporated into the decision-making process. For example:\n\nIn marketing departments, reliable forecasts of demand help in planning of the sale strategies.\n\nA school board needs to able to forecast the increase in the number of school going children in various districts so as to decide where and when to start new schools.\n\nMost often, forecasters use the past data to predict the future. They first analyse the data in order to identify a pattern that can describe it. Then this data and pattern is extended into the future in order to prepare a forecast. This basic strategy is employed in most forecasting techniques, and is based on the assumption that the pattern that has been identified will continue in the future also.\n\nz To estimate. Often, we need to estimate large values. You\u2019ve seen examples of the trees in a forest, fish in a lake, etc. For another example, before elections, the contesting parties want to predict the probability of their party winning the elections. In particular, they want to estimate how many people in their constituency would vote for their party. Based on their predictions, they may want to decide on the campaign strategy.

At some places, minerals contain a very high percentage of a particular metal and the metal can be profitably extracted from it. These minerals are called ores.\n\n### 3.4.1 Extraction of Metals\n\nYou have learnt about the reactivity series of metals. Having this knowledge, you can easily understand how a metal is extracted from its ore. Some metals are found in the earth\u2019s crust in the free state. Some are found in the form of their compounds. The metals at the bottom of the activity series are the least reactive. They are often found in a free state. For example, gold, silver, platinum and copper are found in the free state. Copper and silver are also found in the combined state as their sulphide or oxide ores. The metals at the top of the activity series (K, Na, Ca, Mg and Al) are so reactive that they are never found in nature as free elements.\n\n![](images/09c9fd18fe71c33836f4407c72e9470e9e7acbffb0fafc850921ce9fe2ca06c6.jpg)  \nFigure 3.9 Activity series and related metallurgy\n\nThe metals in the middle of the activity series (Zn, Fe, Pb, etc.) are moderately reactive. They are found in the earth\u2019s crust mainly as oxides, sulphides or carbonates. You will find that the ores of many metals are oxides. This is because oxygen is a very reactive element and is very abundant on the earth.\n\nThus on the basis of reactivity, we can group the metals into the following three categories (Fig. 3.9) \u2013 (i) Metals of low reactivity; (ii) Metals of medium reactivity; (iii) Metals of high reactivity. Different techniques are to be used for obtaining the metals falling in each category.\n\nSeveral steps are involved in the extraction of pure metal from ores.

Different separation techniques are accordingly employed.\n\n### 3.4.3 Extracting Metals Low in the Activity Series\n\nMetals low in the activity series are very unreactive. The oxides of these metals can be reduced to metals by heating alone. For example, cinnabar (HgS) is an ore of mercury. When it is heated in air, it is first converted into mercuric oxide (HgO).

This process is known as roasting. The carbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited air. This process is known as calcination.

The galvanised article is protected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you reason this out?\n\nAlloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal. We can get the desired properties by this method. For example, iron is the most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is because pure iron is very soft and stretches\n\neasily when hot. But, if it is mixed with a small amount of carbon (about $0 . 0 5 \\%$ ), it becomes hard and strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get stainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed with some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties of any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance. The substance added may be a metal or a non-metal.

We saw that ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points and conduct electricity in solution or in the molten state. We also\n\nsaw how the nature of bonding in ionic compounds explains these properties. Let us now study the properties of some carbon compounds.\n\nMost carbon compounds are poor conductors of electricity as we have seen in Chapter 2. From the data given in Table 4.1 on the boiling and melting points of the carbon compounds, we find that these compounds have low melting and boiling points as compared to ionic compounds (Chapter 3). We can conclude that the forces of attraction between the molecules are not very strong. Since these compounds are largely nonconductors of electricity, we can conclude that the bonding in these compounds does not give rise to any ions.\n\nTable 4.1 Melting points and boiling points of some compounds of carbon   \n\n<table><tr><td>Compound</td><td>Melting point (K)</td><td>Boiling point (K)</td></tr><tr><td>Acetic acid (CH3COOH)</td><td>290</td><td>391</td></tr><tr><td>Chloroform (CHCl3)</td><td>209</td><td>334</td></tr><tr><td>Ethanol (CH3CH2OH)</td><td>156</td><td>351</td></tr><tr><td>Methane (CH4)</td><td>90</td><td>111</td></tr></table>\n\nIn Class IX, we learnt about the combining capacity of various elements and how it depends on the number of valence electrons. Let us now look at the electronic configuration of carbon. The atomic number of carbon is 6. What would be the distribution of electrons in various shells of carbon? How many valence electrons will carbon have?\n\nWe know that the reactivity of elements is explained as their tendency to attain a completely filled outer shell, that is, attain noble gas configuration. Elements forming ionic compounds achieve this by either gaining or losing electrons from the outermost shell. In the case of carbon, it has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs to gain or lose four electrons to attain noble gas configuration. If it were to gain or lose electrons \u2013\n\n(i) It could gain four electrons forming $\\mathrm { C } ^ { 4 - }$ anion. But it would be difficult for the nucleus with six protons to hold on to ten electrons, that is, four extra electrons.   \n(ii) It could lose four electrons forming $\\mathrm { C } ^ { 4 + }$ cation. But it would require a large amount of energy to remove four electrons leaving behind a carbon cation with six protons in its nucleus holding on to just two electrons.\n\nCarbon overcomes this problem by sharing its valence electrons with other atoms of carbon or with atoms of other elements. Not just carbon, but many other elements form molecules by sharing electrons in this manner. The shared electrons \u2018belong\u2019 to the outermost shells of both the atoms and lead to both atoms attaining the noble gas configuration.

In fact, we ourselves are made up of carbon compounds. The numbers of carbon compounds whose formulae are known to chemists was recently estimated to be in millions! This outnumbers by a large margin the compounds formed by all the other elements put together. Why is it that this property is seen in carbon and no other element? The nature of the covalent bond\n\nenables carbon to form a large number of compounds. Two factors noticed in the case of carbon are \u2013\n\n(i) Carbon has the unique ability to form bonds with other atoms of carbon, giving rise to large molecules. This property is called catenation. These compounds may have long chains of carbon, branched chains of carbon or even carbon atoms arranged in rings. In addition, carbon atoms may be linked by single, double or triple bonds. Compounds of carbon, which are linked by only single bonds between the carbon atoms are called saturated compounds. Compounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between their carbon atoms are called unsaturated compounds.   \nNo other element exhibits the property of catenation to the extent seen in carbon compounds. Silicon forms compounds with hydrogen which have chains of upto seven or eight atoms, but these compounds are very reactive. The carbon-carbon bond is very strong and hence stable. This gives us the large number of compounds with many carbon atoms linked to each other.   \n(ii) Since carbon has a valency of four, it is capable of bonding with four other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other mono-valent element. Compounds of carbon are formed with oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, chlorine and many other elements giving rise to compounds with specific properties which depend on the elements other than carbon present in the molecule.\n\nAgain the bonds that carbon forms with most other elements are very strong making these compounds exceptionally stable.

It actually means \u2018optically rarer medium\u2019 and \u2018optically denser medium\u2019, respectively. When can we say that a medium is optically denser than the other? In comparing two media, the one with the larger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other. The other medium of lower refractive index is optically rarer. The speed of light is higher in a rarer medium than a denser medium. Thus, a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to a denser medium slows down and bends towards the normal. When it travels from a denser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal.\n\n## \n\n1. A ray of light travelling in air enters obliquely into water.

Have you ever touched the surface of a magnifying glass with your hand? Is it plane surface or curved? Is it thicker in the middle or at the edges? The glasses used in spectacles and that by a watchmaker are examples of lenses. What is a lens? How does it bend light rays? We shall discuss these in this section.\n\nA transparent material bound by two surfaces, of which one or both surfaces are spherical, forms a lens. This means that a lens is bound by at least one spherical surface. In such lenses, the other surface would be plane. A lens may have two spherical surfaces, bulging outwards. Such a lens is called a double convex lens. It is simply called a convex lens. It is thicker at the middle as compared to the edges. Convex lens converges light rays as shown in Fig. 9.12 (a). Hence convex lenses are also called converging lenses. Similarly, a double concave lens is bounded by two spherical surfaces, curved inwards. It is thicker at the edges than at the middle. Such lenses diverge light rays as shown in Fig. 9.12 (b). Such lenses are also called diverging lenses. A double concave lens is simply called a concave lens.\n\n![](images/db98f49c5092ef37ff7fea803b0f5e59419cbdc17bfa7feb4f79e69cd750824e.jpg)  \n(a)\n\nFigure 9.12   \n![](images/ecc025d208c547c33a73b6d8727bbbdfcc9d2340c58a9cbb89e7abba3db6f4c0.jpg)  \n(a) Converging action of a convex lens,   \n(b) diverging action of a concave lens\n\nA lens, either a convex lens or a concave lens, has two spherical surfaces. Each of these surfaces forms a part of a sphere. The centres of these spheres are called centres of curvature of the lens. The centre of curvature of a lens is usually represented by the letter C. Since there are two centres of curvature, we may represent them as $\\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ and $\\mathrm { C } _ { 2 }$ . An imaginary straight line passing through the two centres of curvature of a lens is called its principal axis. The central point of a lens is its optical centre. It is usually represented by the letter O. A ray of light through the optical centre of a lens passes without suffering any deviation. The effective diameter of the circular outline of a spherical lens is called its aperture. We shall confine our discussion in this Chapter to such lenses whose aperture is much less than its radius of curvature and the two centres of curvatures are equidistant from the optical centre O. Such lenses are called thin lenses with small apertures. What happens when parallel rays of light are incident on a lens?

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding 10.1 THE HUMAN EYE.", "context": "The human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs. It enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us. On closing the eyes, we can identify objects to some extent by their smell, taste, sound they make or by touch. It is, however, impossible to identify colours while closing the eyes. Thus, of all the sense organs, the human eye is the most significant one as it enables us to see the beautiful, colourful world around us.\n\nThe human eye is like a camera. Its lens system forms an image on a light-sensitive screen called the retina. Light enters the eye through a thin membrane called the cornea. It forms the transparent bulge on the front surface of the eyeball as shown in Fig. 10.1. The eyeball is approximately spherical in shape with a diameter of about 2.3 cm. Most of the refraction for the light rays entering the eye occurs at the outer surface of the cornea. The crystalline lens merely provides the finer adjustment of focal length required to focus objects at different\n\ndistances on the retina. We find a structure called iris behind the cornea. Iris is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the size of the pupil. The pupil regulates and controls the amount of light entering the eye. The eye lens forms an inverted real image of the object on the retina. The retina is a delicate membrane having enormous number of light-sensitive cells. The light-sensitive cells get activated upon illumination and generate electrical signals. These signals are sent to the brain via the optic nerves. The brain interprets these signals, and finally, processes the information so that we perceive objects as they are.\n\n![](images/8ea946c66c5426cd400894304cdc3fa3ba761c37ddd57d68b50d57d023cc5cfb.jpg)  \nFigure 10.1 The human eye", "response": "In Chapter 10 - The Human Eye and the Colourful World > 10.1 THE HUMAN EYE, the text discusses: The human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding 10.1.1 Power of Accommodation.", "context": "The eye lens is composed of a fibrous, jelly-like material. Its curvature can be modified to some extent by the ciliary muscles. The change in the curvature of the eye lens can thus change its focal length. When the muscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal length increases. This enables us to see distant objects clearly. When you are looking at objects closer to the eye, the ciliary muscles contract. This increases the curvature of the eye lens. The eye lens then becomes thicker. Consequently, the focal length of the eye lens decreases. This enables us to see nearby objects clearly.\n\nThe ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called accommodation. However, the focal length of the eye lens cannot be decreased below a certain minimum limit. Try to read a printed page by holding it very close to your eyes. You may see the image being blurred or feel strain in the eye. To see an object comfortably and distinctly, you must hold it at about $2 5 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ from the eyes. The minimum distance, at which objects can be seen most distinctly without strain, is called the least distance of distinct vision. It is also called the near point of the eye. For a young adult with normal vision, the near point is about $2 5 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ . The farthest point upto which the eye can see objects clearly is called the far point of the eye. It is infinity for a normal eye. You may note here a normal eye can see objects clearly that are between 25 cm and infinity.\n\nSometimes, the crystalline lens of people at old age becomes milky and cloudy.

The band of the coloured components of a light beam is called its spectrum. You might not be able to see all the colours separately. Yet something makes each colour distinct from the other.

Why do we get these colours? Different colours of light bend through different angles with respect to the incident ray, as they pass through a prism. The red light bends the least while the\n\nviolet the most. Thus the rays of each colour emerge along different paths and thus become distinct. It is the band of distinct colours that we see in a spectrum.\n\nIsaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain the spectrum of sunlight. He tried to split the colours of the spectrum of white light further by using another similar prism. However, he could not get any more colours. He then placed a second identical prism in an inverted position with respect to the first prism, as shown in Fig. 10.6. This allowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through the second prism. He found a beam of white light emerging from the other side of the second prism.

We know that flowing water constitute water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric charge flows through a conductor (for example, through a metallic wire), we say that there is an electric current in the conductor. In a torch, we know that the cells (or a battery, when placed in proper order) provide flow of charges or an electric current through the torch bulb to glow. We have also seen that the torch gives light only when its switch is on. What does a switch do? A switch makes a conducting link between the cell and the bulb. A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an electric circuit. Now, if the circuit is broken anywhere (or the switch of the torch is turned of f), the current stops flowing and the bulb does not glow.\n\nHow do we express electric current? Electric current is expressed by the amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. In other words, it is the rate of flow of electric charges. In circuits using metallic wires, electrons constitute the flow of charges. However, electrons were not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first observed. So, electric current was considered to be the flow of positive charges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the direction of electric current. Conventionally, in\n\nan electric circuit the direction of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the flow of electrons, which are negative charges.\n\nIf a net charge Q, flows across any crosssection of a conductor in time t, then the current I, through the cross-section is\n\n$$\nI = \\frac {Q}{t} \\tag {11.1}\n$$", "response": "In Chapter 11 - Electricity > 11.1ELECTRICCURRENTANDCIRCUIT, the text discusses: We are familiar with air current and water current.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding 11.7 HEATING EFFECT OF ELECTRICCURRENT.", "context": "We know that a battery or a cell is a source of electrical energy. The chemical reaction within the cell generates the potential difference between its two terminals that sets the electrons in motion to flow the current through a resistor or a system of resistors connected to the battery. We have also seen, in Section 11.2, that to maintain the current, the source has to keep expending its energy. Where does this energy go? A part of the source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed into useful work (like in rotating the blades of an electric fan). Rest of the source energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature of gadget. We often observe this in our everyday life. For example, an electric fan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other hand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration of resistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually gets dissipated entirely in the form of heat. This is known as the heating effect of electric current. This effect is utilised in devices such as electric heater, electric iron etc.\n\nConsider a current I flowing through a resistor of resistance $R$ . Let the potential difference across it be V (Fig. 11.13). Let $t$ be the time during which a charge $\\boldsymbol { Q }$ flows across. The work done in moving the charge $\\boldsymbol { Q }$ through a potential difference $V$ is $V Q$ . Therefore, the source must supply energy equal to $V Q$ in time t. Hence the power input to the circuit by the source is\n\n$$\nP = V \\frac {Q}{t} = V I \\tag {11.19}\n$$\n\nOr the energy supplied to the circuit by the source in time t is $P \\ \\times \\ t _ { - }$ , that is, VIt.

In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful electrical energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heating can increase the temperature of the components and alter their properties. However, heating effect of electric current has many useful applications. The electric laundry iron, electric toaster, electric oven, electric kettle and electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joule\u2019s heating.\n\nThe electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric bulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is possible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such high temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as tungsten (melting point $3 3 8 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ is used for making bulb filaments. The filament should be thermally isolated as much as possible, using insulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually\n\nfilled with chemically inactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most of the power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part of it is in the form of light radiated.\n\nAnother common application of Joule\u2019s heating is the fuse used in electric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow of any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series with the device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of appropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper, iron, lead etc. If a current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit, the temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and breaks the circuit. The fuse wire is usually encased in a cartridge of porcelain or similar material with metal ends. The fuses used for domestic purposes are rated as 1 A, 2 A, 3 A, 5 A, 10 A, etc. For an electric iron which consumes $1 \\mathrm { k W }$ electric power when operated at 220 V, a current of (1000/220) A, that is, 4.54 A will flow in the circuit.

Similarly at every point of a current-carrying circular loop, the concentric circles representing the magnetic field around it would become larger and larger as we move away from the wire (Fig. 12.8). By the time we reach at the centre of the circular loop, the arcs of these big circles would appear as straight lines. Every point on the wire carrying current would give rise to the magnetic field appearing as straight lines at the center of the loop. By applying the right hand rule, it is easy to check that every section of the wire contributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction within the loop.\n\n![](images/8348108c1045cd3d367c3c859e7e9d4f69bc7a74648b36371580df8c93d44795.jpg)  \nFigure 12.8\n\nMagnetic field lines of the field produced by a current-carrying circular loop\n\nWe know that the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire at a given point depends directly on the current passing through it. Therefore, if there is a circular coil having n turns, the field produced is n times as large as that produced by a single turn. This is because the current in each circular turn has the same direction, and the field due to each turn then just adds up.\n\n* This rule is also called Maxwell\u2019s corkscrew rule. If we consider ourselves driving a corkscrew in the direction of the current, then the direction of the rotation of corkscrew is the direction of the magnetic field..\n\n#### Activity 12.6\n\n\u25a0 Take a rectangular cardboard having two holes.

The field lines inside the solenoid are in the form of parallel straight lines. This indicates that the magnetic field is the same at all points inside the solenoid. That is, the field is uniform inside the solenoid.\n\nA strong magnetic field produced inside a solenoid can be used to magnetise a piece of magnetic material, like soft iron, when placed inside the coil (Fig. 12.11).

Support for the magnet is not shown here, for simplicity.\n\n\u25a0 Take a small aluminium rod AB (of about 5 cm). Using two connecting wires suspend it horizontally from a stand, as shown in Fig. 12.12.   \n\u25a0 Place a strong horse-shoe magnet in such a way that the rod lies between the two poles with the magnetic field directed upwards. For this put the north pole of the magnet vertically below and south pole vertically above the aluminium rod (Fig. 12.12).   \n\u25a0 Connect the aluminium rod in series with a battery, a key and a rheostat.   \n\u25a0 Now pass a current through the aluminium rod from end B to end A.   \n\u25a0 What do you observe? It is observed that the rod is displaced towards the left. You will notice that the rod gets displaced.   \n\u25a0 Reverse the direction of current flowing through the rod and observe the direction of its displacement. It is now towards the right. Why does the rod get displaced?\n\nThe displacement of the rod in the above activity suggests that a force is exerted on the current-carrying aluminium rod when it is placed in a magnetic field. It also suggests that the direction of force is also reversed when the direction of current through the conductor is reversed. Now change the direction of field to vertically downwards by interchanging the two poles of the magnet. It is once again observed that the direction of force acting on the currentcarrying rod gets reversed. It shows that the direction of the force on the conductor depends upon the direction of current and the direction of the magnetic field. Experiments have shown that the displacement of the rod is largest (or the\n\nmagnitude of the force is the highest) when the direction of current is at right angles to the direction of the magnetic field. In such a condition we can use a simple rule to find the direction of the force on the conductor.\n\nIn Activity 12.7, we considered the direction of the current and that of the magnetic field perpendicular to each other and found that the force is perpendicular to both of them. The three directions can be illustrated through a simple rule, called Fleming\u2019s left-hand rule. According to this rule, stretch the thumb, forefinger and middle finger of your left hand such that they are mutually perpendicular (Fig. 12.13). If the first finger points in the direction of magnetic field and the second finger in the direction of current, then the thumb will point in the direction of motion or the force acting on the conductor.\n\n![](images/bffcc4d73d6790447b7ab6ab71a4029526404d48919d8986e6f306724ce11cb6.jpg)  \nFigure 12.13   \nFleming\u2019s left-hand rule\n\nDevices that use current-carrying conductors and magnetic fields include electric motor, electric generator, loudspeakers, microphones and measuring instruments.", "response": "This activity involves: ![](images/8fed64c9de73ac188e8166203016374da3b41e7e66430e71f4bf4f5482a252e4.jpg)  \nFigure 12.12 A current-carrying rod, AB, experiences a force perpendicular to its length and the magnetic field.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding 12.4 DOMESTIC ELECTRIC CIRCUITS.", "context": "In our homes, we receive supply of electric power through a main supply (also called mains), either supported through overhead electric poles or by underground cables. One of the wires in this supply, usually with red insulation cover, is called live wire (or positive). Another wire, with black insulation, is called neutral wire (or negative). In our country, the potential difference between the two is $2 2 0 \\mathrm { V } .$ .\n\nAt the meter-board in the house, these wires pass into an electricity meter through a main fuse. Through the main switch they are\n\nconnected to the line wires in the house. These wires supply electricity to separate circuits within the house. Often, two separate circuits are used, one of 15A current rating for appliances with higher power ratings such as geysers, air coolers, etc. The other circuit is of 5A current rating for bulbs, fans, etc. The earth wire, which has insulation of green colour, is usually connected to a metal plate deep in the earth near the house. This is used as a safety measure, especially for those appliances that have a metallic body, for example, electric press, toaster, table fan, refrigerator, etc. The metallic body is connected to the earth wire, which provides a low-resistance conducting path for the current. Thus, it ensures that any leakage of current to the metallic body of the appliance keeps its potential to that of the earth, and the user may not get a severe electric shock.\n\n![](images/8a2d590da04ac796a352ff0f5fdfd59464d2edee450e7ded9e0d9c4ecdf6cd8a.jpg)  \nFigure 12.15 A schematic diagram of one of the common domestic circuits\n\nFigure 12.15 gives a schematic diagram of one of the common domestic circuits. In each separate circuit, different appliances can be connected across the live and neutral wires. Each appliance has a separate switch to \u2018ON\u2019/\u2018OFF\u2019 the flow of current through it. In order that each appliance has equal potential difference, they are connected parallel to each other.\n\nElectric fuse is an important component of all domestic circuits. We have already studied the principle and working of a fuse in the previous chapter (see Section 11.7). A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the appliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur when the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. (This occurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the appliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly increases. This is called short-circuiting. The use of an electric fuse prevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage by stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating that takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit. Overloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply voltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many appliances to a single socket.\n\n##", "response": "In Chapter 12 - Magnetic Effects of Electric Current > 12.4 DOMESTIC ELECTRIC CIRCUITS, the text discusses: In our homes, we receive supply of electric power through a main supply (also called mains), either supported through overhead electric poles or by un..."}

As usual, Vetal started telling Vikram a story to keep him awake while driving. This time the story went as follows:\n\n\u201cIn the city of Beirut, there lived a man called Khalil. His parents came from diff erent communities. His father was an Orthodox Christian and mother a Sunni Muslim. This was not so uncommon in this modern, cosmopolitan city. People from various communities that lived in Lebanon came to live in its capital, Beirut. They lived together, intermingled, yet fought a bitter civil war among themselves. One of Khalil\u2019s uncles was killed in that war.\n\nAt the end of this civil war, Lebanon\u2019s leaders came together and agreed to some basic rules for power sharing among diff erent communities. As per these rules, the country\u2019s President must belong to the Maronite sect of Catholic Christians. The Prime Minister must be from the Sunni Muslim community. The post of Deputy Prime Minister is fi xed for Orthodox Christian sect and that of the Speaker for Shi\u2019a Muslims. Under this pact, the Christians agreed not to seek French protection and the Muslims agreed not to seek unifi cation with the neighbouring state of Syria.When the Christians and Muslims came to this agreement, they were nearly equal in population. Both sides have continued to respect this agreement though now the Muslims are in clear majority.\n\nKhalil does not like this system one bit. He is a popular man with political ambition. But under the present system, the top position is out of his reach. He does not practise either his father\u2019s or his mother\u2019s religion and does not wish to be known by either. He cannot understand why Lebanon can\u2019t be like any other \u2018normal\u2019 democracy. \u201cJust hold an election, allow everyone to contest and whoever wins maximum votes becomes the president, no matter which community he comes from.

During the same time, the US president visited Russia. What, according to this cartoon, is the relationship between democracy and concentration of power? Can you think of some other examples to illustrate the point being made here?\n\npower should be distributed among as many citizens as possible.\n\nIn modern democracies, power sharing arrangements can take many forms. Let us look at some of the most common arrangements that we have or will come across.\n\n1 Power is shared among different organs of government, such as the legislature, executive and judiciary. Let us call this horizontal distribution of power because it allows different organs of government placed at the same level to exercise different powers. Such a separation ensures that none of the organs can exercise unlimited power. Each organ checks the others. This results in a balance of power among various institutions. Last year, we studied that in a democracy, even though ministers and government officials exercise power, they are responsible to the Parliament or State Assemblies. Similarly, although judges are appointed by the executive, they can check the functioning of executive or laws made by the legislatures. This arrangement is called a system of checks and balances.\n\n2 Power can be shared among governments at different levels \u2013 a general government for the entire country and governments at the provincial or regional level. Such a general government for the entire country is usually called federal government. In India, we refer to it as the Central or Union Government. The governments at the provincial or regional level are called by different names in different countries.\n\nI n I n d i a , w e c a l l t h e m S t a t e Governments. This system is not followed in all countries. There are many countries where there are no provincial or state governments. But in those countries like ours, where there are different levels of government, the constitution clearly lays down the powers of different levels of government. This is what they did in Belgium, but was refused in Sri Lanka. This is called federal division of power. The same principle can be extended to levels of government lower than the State government, such as the municipality and panchayat. Let us call division of powers involving higher and lower levels of government vertical division of power. We shall study these at some length in the next chapter.\n\n3 Power may also be shared among different social groups, such as the religious and linguistic groups. \u2018Community government\u2019 in Belgium is a good example of this arrangement. In some countries, there are constitutional and legal arrangements, whereby socially weaker sections and women are represented in the legislatures and administration.

This method is used to give minority communities a fair share in power. In Unit II, we shall look at various ways of accommodating social diversities.\n\n4 Power sharing arrangements can also be seen in the way political parties, pressure groups and movements control or infl uence those in power. In a democracy, the citizens must have freedom to choose among various contenders for power. In contemporary democracies, this takes the form of competition among different parties. Such competition ensures that power does not remain in one hand. In the long run, power is shared among different political parties that represent different ideologies and social groups. Sometimes this kind of sharing can be direct, when two or more parties form an alliance to contest elections. If their alliance is elected, they form a coalition government and thus share power. In a democracy, we fi nd interest groups, such as those of traders, businessmen, industrialists, farmers and industrial workers. They also will have a share in governmental power, either through participation in governmental committees or bringing infl uence on the decision-making process.

You would recall that one of the key changes made in the Constitution of Belgium was to reduce the power of the Central Government and to give these powers to the regional governments. Regional governments existed in Belgium even earlier. They had their roles and powers. But all these powers were given to these governments and could be withdrawn by the Central Government. The change that took place in 1993 was that the regional governments were given constitutional powers that were no longer dependent on the central government. Thus, Belgium shifted from a unitary to a federal form of government. Sri Lanka continues\n\nto be, for all practical purposes, a unitary system where the national government has all the powers. Tamil leaders want Sri Lanka to become a federal system.\n\nFederalism is a system of government in which the power is divided between a central authority and various constituent units of the country. Usually, a federation has two levels of government. One is the government for the entire country that is usually responsible for a few subjects of common national interest. The others are governments at the level of provinces or states that look after much of the dayto-day administering of their state. Both these levels of governments enjoy their power independent of the other.\n\n![](images/a7ae9b7e5b610c18bd5c38a55591ff7f7369b1d0a20a4897799faffba7ddd7f2.jpg)  \nThough only 25 of the world\u2019s 193 countries have federal political systems, their citizens make up 40 per cent of the world\u2019s population. Most of the large countries of the world are federations. Can you notice an exception to this rule in this map?\n\nIn this sense, federations are contrasted with unitary governments. Under the unitary system, either there is only one level of government or the sub-units are subordinate to the central government. The central government can pass on orders to the provincial or the local government. But in a federal system, the central government cannot order the state government to do something.

So the existence and authority of each tier of government is constitutionally guaranteed.   \n4 The fundamental provisions of the constitution cannot be unilaterally changed by one level of government. Such changes require the consent of both the levels of government.   \n5 Courts have the power to interpret the constitution and the powers of different levels of government. The highest court acts as an umpire if disputes arise between different levels of government in the exercise of their respective powers.   \n6 Sources of revenue for each level of government are clearly specifi ed to ensure its fi nancial autonomy.\n\n7 The federal system thus has dual objectives: to safeguard and promote unity of the country, while at the same time accommodate regional diversity. Therefore, two aspects are crucial for the institutions and practice of federalism. Governments at different levels should agree to some rules of power-sharing. They should also trust that each would abide by its part of the agreement. An ideal federal system has both aspects : mutual trust and agreement to live together.\n\nThe exact balance of power between the central and the state government varies from one federation to another. This balance depends mainly on the historical context in which the federation was formed. There are two kinds of routes through which federations have been formed. The fi rst route involves independent States coming together on their own to form a bigger unit, so that by pooling sovereignty and retaining identity, they can increase their security. This type of \u2018coming together\u2019 federations include the USA, Switzerland and Australia. In this fi rst category of federations, all the constituent States usually have equal power and are strong vis-\u00e0-vis the federal government.\n\nThe second route is where a large country decides to divide its power between the constituent States and the national government. India, Spain and Belgium are examples of this kind of \u2018holding together\u2019 federations. In this second category, the Central Government tends to be more powerful vis-\u00e0-vis the States.

What about a vast country like India, with so many languages, religions and regions? What are the power sharing arrangements in our country?\n\nLet us begin with the Constitution. India had emerged as an independent nation after a painful and bloody partition. Soon after Independence, several princely states became a part of the country. The Constitution declared India as a Union of States. Although it did not use the word federation, the Indian Union is based on the principles of federalism.\n\nLet us go back to the seven features of federalism mentioned above. We can see that all these features apply to the provisions of the Indian Constitution. The Constitution originally provided for a two-tier system of government, the Union Government or what we call the Central Government, representing the Union of India and the State governments. Later, a third tier of federalism was added\n\nin the form of Panchayats and Municipalities. As in any federation, these different tiers enjoy separate jurisdiction. The Constitution clearly provided a three-fold distribution of legislative powers between the Union Government and the State Governments. Thus, it contains three lists:\n\nUnion List includes subjects of national importance, such as defence of the country, foreign affairs, banking, communications and currency. They are included in this list because we need a uniform policy on these matters throughout the country. The Union Government alone can make laws relating to the subjects mentioned in the Union List.   \nState List contains subjects of State and local importance, such as police, trade, commerce, agriculture and irrigation. The State Governments alone can make laws relating to the subjects mentioned in the State List.   \n\uf06c Concurrent List includes subjects of common interest to both the Union Government as well as the State Governments, such as\n\nIsn\u2019t that strange?

Both the Union as well as the State Governments can make laws on the subjects mentioned in this list. If their laws conflict with each other, the law made by the Union Government will prevail.\n\nWhat about subjects that do not fall in any of the three lists?

Thus, all States in the Indian Union do not have identical powers. Some States enjoy a special status. States such as Assam, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram enjoy special powers under certain provisions of the Constitution of India (Article 371) due to their peculiar social and historical circumstances. These special powers are especially enjoyed in relation to the protection of land rights of indigenous peoples, their culture and also preferential employment in government services. Indians who are not permanent residents of this State cannot buy land or house here. Similar special provisions exist for some other States of India as well.\n\nThere are some units of the Indian Union which enjoy very little power. These are areas which are too small to become an independent State but which could not be merged with any of the existing States. These areas, like Chandigarh, or Lakshadweep or the capital city of Delhi, are called Union Territories. These territories do not have the powers of a State. The Central Government has special powers in running these areas.\n\nThis sharing of power between the Union Government and the State Governments is basic to the structure of the Constitution. It is not easy to make changes to this power sharing arrangement. The Parliament cannot on its own change this arrangement. Any change to it has to be first passed by both the Houses of Parliament with at least two-thirds majority. Then it has to be ratified by the legislatures of at least half of the total States.\n\nThe judiciary plays an important role in overseeing the implementation of constitutional provisions and procedures.

The latest information that we have is from the Census of India held in 2011. This census recorded more than 1300 distinct languages which people mentioned as their mother tongues. These languages were grouped together under some major languages. For example, languages like Bhojpuri, Magadhi, Bundelkhandi, Chhattisgarhi, Rajasthani and many others were grouped together under \u2018Hindi\u2019. Even after this grouping, the Census found 121 major languages. Of these, 22 languages are now included in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution and are therefore called \u2018Scheduled Languages\u2019. Others are called \u2018non-Scheduled Languages\u2019. In terms of languages, India is perhaps the most diverse country in the world.\n\nA look at the enclosed table makes it clear that no one language is the mother tongue of the majority of our population. The largest language, Hindi, is the mother tongue of only about 44 per cent Indians. If we add to that all those who knew Hindi as their second or third language, the total number was still less than 50 per cent in 2011.

I always prefer the lower berth!\n\nWe noted above that federal governments have two or more tiers of governments. We have so far discussed the two-tiers of government in our country. But a vast country like India cannot b e r u n o n l y t h r o u g h t h e s e two-tiers. States in India are as large as independent countries of Europe. In terms of population, Uttar Pradesh is bigger than Russia, Maharashtra is about as big as Germany. Many of these States are internally very diverse. There is thus a need for power sharing within these States. Federal power sharing in India needs another tier of government, below that of the State governments. This is the rationale for decentralisation of power. Thus, resulted a thirdtier of government, called local government.\n\nWhen power is taken away from Central and State governments and given to local government, it is called decentralisation. The basic idea behind decentralisation is that there are a large number of problems and issues which are best settled at the local level. People have better knowledge of problems in their localities. They also have better ideas on where to spend money and how to manage things more effi ciently. Besides, at the local level it is possible for the people to directly participate in decision making. This helps to inculcate a habit of democratic participation. Local government is the best way to realise one important principle of democracy, namely local self-government.\n\nThe need for decentralisation was recognised in our Constitution. Since then, there have been several attempts to decentralise\n\npower to the level of villages and towns. Panchayats in villages and municipalities in urban areas were set up in all the States. But these were directly under the control of state governments. Elections to these local governments were not held regularly. Local governments did not have any powers or resources of their own. Thus, there was very little decentralisation in effective terms.\n\nA major step towards decentralisation was taken in 1992. The Constitution was amended to make the third-tier of democracy more powerful and effective.\n\nNow it is constitutionally mandatory to hold regular elections to local government bodies.   \nSeats are reserved in the elected bodies and the executive heads of these institutions for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.   \nAt least one-third of all positions are reserved for women.   \nAn independent institution called the State Election Commission has been created in each State to conduct panchayat and municipal elections.   \nThe State governments are required to share some powers and revenue with local government bodies. The nature of sharing varies from State to State.\n\nRural local government is popularly known by the name panchayati raj. Each village, or a group of villages in some States, has a gram panchayat. This is a council consisting of several ward members, often called panch, and a president or sarpanch.

It has to meet at least twice or thrice in a year to approve the annual budget of the gram panchayat and to review the performance of the gram panchayat.\n\nThe local government structure goes right up to the district level. A few gram panchayats are grouped together to form what is usually called a panchayat samiti or block or mandal. The members of this representative body are elected by all the panchyat members in that area. All the panchayat samitis or mandals in a district together constitute\n\nthe zilla (district) parishad.

Each sector has a meeting, like that of the gram sabha, in which anyone living in that area can participate. There are some meetings to discuss issues that aff ect the entire city. Any citizen of the city can participate in those meetings. The budget of the city is discussed in these meetings. The proposals are put to the municipality that takes a fi nal decision about it.\n\nAbout 20,000 people participate in this decision making exercise every year. This method has ensured that the money cannot be spent only for the benefi t of the colonies where rich people live.

It is not that men cannot do housework; they simply think that it is for women to attend to these things. When these jobs are paid for, men are ready to take up these works. Most tailors or cooks in hotels are men. Similarly, it is not that women do not work outside their home. In villages, women fetch water, collect fuel and work in the fi elds. In urban areas, poor women work as domestic helper in middle class homes, while middle class women work in offi ces. In fact, the majority of women do some sort of paid work in addition to domestic labour. But their work is not valued and does not get recognition.\n\nThe result of this division of labour is that although women constitute half of the humanity, their role in public life, especially politics, is minimal in most societies. Earlier, only men were allowed to participate in public affairs, vote and contest for public offices. Gradually the gender issue was raised in politics.

India is behind the averages for several developing countries of Africa and Latin America. In the government, cabinets are largely all-male even when a woman becomes the Chief Minister or the Prime Minister.\n\nOne way to solve this problem is to make it legally binding to have a fair proportion of women in the elected bodies. This is what the Panchayati Raj has done in India. One-third of seats in local government bodies \u2013 in panchayats and municipalities \u2013 are now reserved for women. Now there are more than 10 lakh elected women representatives in rural and urban local bodies.\n\nWomen\u2019s organisations and activists have been demanding a similar reservation of at least one-third of seats in the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies for women.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding Communalism.", "context": "The problem begins when religion is seen as the basis of the nation. The example of Northern Ireland in Chapter 3 shows the dangers of such an approach to nationalism. The problem becomes more acute when religion is expressed in politics in exclusive and partisan terms, when one religion and its followers are pitted against another. This happens when beliefs of one religion are presented as superior to those of other religions, when the demands of one religious group are formed in opposition to another and when state power is used to establish domination of one religious group over the rest. This manner of using religion in politics is communal politics.\n\nCommunal politics is based on the idea that religion is the principal basis of social community. Communalism involves thinking\n\nI am not religious.\n\nWhy should I bother about communalism and secularism?\n\nalong the following lines. The followers of a particular religion must belong to one community. Their fundamental interests are the same. Any difference that they may have is irrelevant or trivial for community life. It also follows that people who follow different religions cannot belong to the same social community. If the followers of different religions have some commonalities these are superfi cial and immaterial, their interests are bound to be different and involve a conflict. In its extreme form, communalism leads to the belief that people belonging to different religions cannot live as equal citizens within one nation. Either, one of them has to dominate the rest or they have to form different nations.\n\nThis belief is fundamentally flawed. People of one religion do not have the same interests and aspirations in every context. Everyone has several other roles, positions and identities. There are many voices inside every community. All these voices have a right to be heard. Therefore any attempt to bring all followers of one religion together in context other than religion is bound to suppress many voices within that community.\n\nCommunalism can take various forms in politics:\n\n\uf06c The most common expression of communalism is in everyday beliefs. These routinely involve religious prejudices, stereotypes of religious communities and belief in the superiority of one\u2019s religion over other religions. This is so common\n\nthat we often fail to notice it, even when we believe in it.\n\n\uf06c A communal mind often leads to a quest for political dominance of one\u2019s own religious community.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding Social and Religious Diversity of India.", "context": "The Census of India records the religion of each and every Indian after every ten years. The person who fi lls the Census form visits every household and records the religion of each member of that household exactly the way each person describes it. If someone says she has \u2018no religion\u2019 or that he is an \u2018atheist\u2019, this is exactly how it is recorded. Thus we have reliable information on the proportion of diff erent religious communities in the country and how it has changed over the years. The pie chart below presents the population proportion of six major religious communities in the country. Since Independence, the total population of each community has increased substantially but their proportion in the country\u2019s population has not changed much. In percentage terms, the population of the Hindus, Jains and Christians has declined marginally since 1961. The proportion of Muslim, Sikh and Buddhist population has increased slightly. There is a common but mistaken impression that the proportion of the Muslims in the country\u2019s population is going to overtake other religious communities. Expert estimates done for the Prime Minister\u2019s High Level Committee (popularly known as Sachar Committee) show that the proportion of the Muslims is expected to go up a little, by about 3 to 4 per cent, in the next 50 years. It proves that in overall terms, the population balance of diff erent religious communities is not likely to change in a big way.\n\nThe same is true of the major caste groups. The Census of India counts two social groups: the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. Both these broad groups include hundreds of castes or tribes whose names are listed in an offi cial Schedule. Hence the prefi x \u2018Scheduled\u2019 in their name. The Scheduled Castes, commonly known as Dalits, include those that were previously regarded as \u2018outcaste\u2019 in the Hindu social order and were subjected to exclusion and untouchability. The Scheduled Tribes, often referred to as Adivasis, include those communities that led a secluded life usually in hills and forests and did not interact much with the rest of society. In 2011, the Scheduled\n\nCastes were 16.6 per cent and the Scheduled Tribes were 8.6 per cent of the country\u2019s population.\n\nThe Census does not yet count the Other Backward Classes, the group we discussed in Class IX. Hence there are some differences about their proportion in the country\u2019s population. The National Sample Survey of 2004\u201305 estimates their population to be around 41 per cent.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding Functions.", "context": "What does a political party do? Basically, political parties fi ll political offi ces and exercise political power. Parties do so by performing a series of functions:\n\nParties contest elections. In most democracies, elections are fought\n\nmainly among the candidates put up by political parties. Parties select their candidates in different ways. In some countries, such as the USA, members and supporters of a party choose its candidates. Now more and more countries are following this method. In other countries like India, top party leaders choose candidates for contesting elections.\n\n2 Parties put forward different policies and programmes and the voters choose from them. Each of us may have different opinions and views on what policies are suitable for the society. But no government can handle such a large variety of views. In a democracy, a large number of similar opinions have to be grouped together to provide a direction in which policies can be formulated by the governments. This is what the parties do. A party reduces a vast multitude of opinions into a few basic positions which it\n\nsupports. A government is expected to base its policies on the line taken by the RULING P ARTY.\n\n3 Parties play a decisive role in making laws for a country. Formally, laws are debated and passed in the legislature. But since most of the members belong to a party, they go by the direction of the party leadership, irrespective of their personal opinions.   \n4 Parties form and run governments. As we noted last year, the big policy decisions are taken by political executive that comes from the political parties. Parties recruit leaders, train them and then make them ministers to run the government in the way they want.   \n5 Those parties that lose in the elections play the role of opposition to the parties in power, by voicing different views and criticising government for its failures or wrong policies. Opposition parties also mobilise opposition to the government.   \n6 Parties shape public opinion. They raise and highlight issues. Parties have lakhs of members and activists spread all over the country. Many of the pressure groups are the extensions of political parties among different sections of society. Parties sometimes also launch movements for the resolution of problems faced by people. Often opinions in the society crystallise on the lines parties take.   \n7 Parties provide people access to government machinery and welfare schemes implemented by governments. For an ordinary citizen it is easy to approach a local party leader than a government offi cer.\n\nThat is why, they feel close to parties even when they do not fully trust them.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding Necessity.", "context": "This list of functions in a sense answers the question asked above: we need political parties because they perform all these functions. But we still need to ask why modern democracies cannot exist without political parties. We can understand the necessity of political parties by imagining a situation without parties. Every candidate in the elections will be independent. So no one will be able to make any promises to the people about any major policy changes. The government may be formed, but its utility will remain ever uncertain. Elected representatives will be accountable to their constituency for what they do in the locality. But no one will be responsible for how the country will be run.\n\nWe can also think about it by looking at the non-party based elections to the panchayat in many states. Although, the parties do not contest formally, it is generally noticed that the village gets split into more than one faction, each of which puts up a \u2018panel\u2019 of its candidates. This is exactly what the party does. That is the reason we fi nd political parties in almost all countries of the world, whether these countries are big or small, old or new, developed or developing.\n\nThe rise of political parties is directly linked to the emergence of representative democracies.\n\n\nOkay, granted that we can\u2019t live without political parties. But tell me on what grounds do people support a political party?\n\n\nRuling Party: Political party that runs government.\n\nAs we have seen, large societies need representative democracy. As societies became large and complex, they also needed some agency to gather different views on various issues and to present these to the government. They needed some ways, to bring various representatives together so that a\n\nresponsible government could be formed. They needed a mechanism to support or restrain the government, make policies, justify or oppose them. Political parties fulfi ll these needs that every representative government has. We can say that parties are a necessary condition for a democracy.\n\n![](images/502384c28572f69f17b101111427a0d930adb511847bf62ff19a4a57813c9175.jpg)\n\nCategorise these photographs by the functions of political parties they illustrate.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding How many parties should we have?.", "context": "In a democracy any group of citizens is free to form a political party. In this formal sense, there are a large number of political parties in each country. More than 750 parties are registered with the Election Commission of India. But not all these parties are serious contenders in the elections. Usually only a handful of parties are effectively in\n\nthe race to win elections and form the government. So the question is: how many major or effective parties are good for a democracy?\n\nIn some countries, only one party is allowed to control and run the government. These are called one-party systems. In Class IX, we noted that in China, only the Communist Party is allowed to\n\nrule. Although, legally speaking, people are free to form political parties, it does not happen because the electoral system does not permit free competition for power. We cannot consider one-party system as a good option because this is not a democratic option. Any democratic system must allow at least two parties to compete in elections and provide a fair chance for the competing parties to come to power.\n\nIn some countries, power usually changes between two main parties. Several other parties may exist, contest elections and win a few seats in the national legislatures. But only the two main parties have a serious chance of winning majority of seats to form government. Such a party system is called two-party system. The United States of America and the United Kingdom are examples of two-party system.\n\nIf several parties compete for power, and more than two parties have a reasonable chance of coming to power either on their own strength or in alliance with others, we call it a multiparty system. Thus in India, we have a multiparty system. In this system, the government is formed by various parties coming together in a\n\ncoalition. When several parties in a multi-party system join hands for the purpose of contesting elections and winning power, it is called an alliance or a front. For example, in India there were three such major alliances in 2004 parliamentary elections\u2013 the National Democratic Alliance, the United Progressive Alliance and the Left Front. The multiparty system often appears very messy and leads to political instability. At the same time, this system allows a variety of interests and opinions to enjoy political representation.\n\nSo, which of these is better? Perhaps the best answer to this very common question is that this is not a very good question. Party system is not something any country can choose. It evolves over a long time, depending on the nature of society, its social and regional divisions, its history of politics and its system of elections. These cannot be changed very quickly. Each country develops a party system that is conditioned by its special circumstances. For example, if India has evolved a multiparty system, it is because the social and geographical diversity in such a large country is not easily absorbed by two or even three parties. No system is ideal for all countries and all situations.", "response": "In Chapter 4 - Political Parties > How many parties should we have?, the text discusses: In a democracy any group of citizens is free to form a political party.

Since parties are the most visible face of democracy, it is natural that people blame parties for whatever is wrong with the working of democracy.

Popular dissatisfaction and criticism has focussed on four problem areas\n\nBerlusconi Puppet Theatre\n\nin the working of political parties. Political parties need to face and overcome these challenges in order to remain effective instruments of democracy.\n\nThe first challenge is lack of internal democracy within parties. All over the world there is a tendency in political parties towards the concentration of power in one or few leaders at the top. Parties do not keep membership registers, do not hold organisational meetings, and do not conduct internal elections regularly. Ordinary members of not get sufficient n what happens inside\n\nthe party. They do not have the means or the connections needed to infl uence the decisions.

More than loyalty to party principles and policies, personal loyalty to the leader becomes more important.\n\nThe second challenge of dynastic succession is related to the first one. Since most political parties do not practice open and transparent procedures for their functioning, there are very few ways for an ordinary worker to rise to the top in a party. Those who happen to be the leaders are in a position of unfair advantage to favour people close to them or even their family members. In many parties, the top positions are always controlled by members of one family. This is unfair to other members of that party. This is also bad for democracy, since people who do not have adequate experience or popular support come to occupy positions of power.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding Challenges to political parties.", "context": "The third challenge is about the growing role of money and muscle power in parties, especially during elections. Since parties are focussed only on winning elections, they tend to use short-cuts to win elections. They tend to nominate those candidates who have or can raise lots of money. Rich people and companies who give funds to the parties tend to have infl uence on the policies and decisions of the party. In some cases, parties support criminals who can win elections. Democrats all over the world are worried about the increasing role of rich people and big companies in democratic politics.\n\nThe fourth challenge is that very often parties do not seem to offer a meaningful choice to the voters. In order to offer meaningful choice, parties must be signifi cantly different. In recent years, there has been a decline in the ideological differences among parties in most parts of the world. For example, the difference between the Labour Party and the Conservative Party in Britain is very little. They agree on more fundamental aspects but differ only in details on how policies are to be framed and implemented. In our country too, the differences among all the major parties on the economic policies have reduced. Those who want really different policies have no option available to them.

He received several international honours for his eff orts to promote economic and social development for the benefi t of the poor. He and the Grameen Bank that he started jointly, received the Nobel Peace Prize for the year 2006. In February 2007, he decided to launch a political party and contest in the parliamentary elections. His objective was to foster proper leadership, good governance and build a new Bangladesh. He felt that only a political party diff erent from the traditional ones would bring about new political culture. His party would be democratic from the grassroots level.\n\nThe launching of the new party, called Nagarik Shakti (Citizens\u2019 Power), has caused a stir among the Bangladeshis. While many welcomed his decision, some did not like it. \u201cNow I think Bangladesh will have a chance to choose between good and bad and eventually have a good government,\u201d said Shahedul Islam, a government offi cial. \u201cThat government, we hope, would not only keep itself away from corruption but also make fi ghting corruption and black money a top priority.\u201d\n\nBut leaders of traditional political parties who dominated the country\u2019s politics for decades were apprehensive. \u201cThere was no debate (over him) winning the Nobel, but politics is diff erent \u2013 very challenging and often controversial,\u201d said a senior leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Some others were highly critical. They asked why he was rushing into politics. \u201cIs he being planted in politics by mentors from outside the country,\u201d asked one political observer.\n\nDo you think Yunus made a right decision to fl oat a new political party?", "response": "In Chapter 4 - Political Parties > Exercies, the text discusses: 1.

When we talk to people around us, most of them support democracy against other alternatives, such as rule by a monarch or military or religious leaders. But not so many of them would be satisfied with the democracy in practice. So we face a dilemma: democracy is seen to be good in\n\n\u00a9 RK Laxman - Brushing up the years   \n![](images/c0a1f1ec6d6537bad6896d6567d5e8978d2461ca77c52fe2e4d96aa8b851efe8.jpg)  \nIs democracy all about coping with multiple pressures and accommodating diverse demands?\n\nprinciple, but felt to be not so good in its practice. This dilemma invites us to think hard about the outcomes of democracy. Do we prefer democracy only for moral reasons? Or are there some prudential reasons to support democracy too?\n\nOver a hundred countries of the world today claim and practice some kind of democratic politics: they have formal constitutions, they hold elections, they have parties and they guarantee rights of citizens. While these features are common to most of them, these democracies are very much different from each other in terms of their social situations, their economic achievements and their cultures. Clearly, what may be achieved or not achieved under each of these democracies will be very different. But is there something that we can expect from every democracy, just because it is democracy?\n\nOur interest in and fascination for democracy often pushes us into taking a position that democracy can address all socio-economic and political problems. If some of our expectations are not met, we start blaming the idea of democracy. Or, we start doubting if we are living in a democracy. The fi rst step towards thinking carefully about the outcomes of democracy is to recognise that democracy is just a form of government. It can only create conditions for achieving something. The citizens have to take advantage of those conditions and achieve those goals.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding Accountable, responsive and legitimate government.", "context": "There are some things that democracy must provide. In a democracy, we are most concerned with ensuring that people will have the right to choose their rulers and people will have control over the rulers. Whenever possible and necessary, citizens should be able to participate in decision making, that affects them all. Therefore, the most basic outcome of democracy should be that it produces a government that is accountable to the citizens, and responsive to the needs and expectations of the citizens.\n\nBefore we go into this question, we face another common question: Is the democratic government effi cient? Is it effective? Some people think that democracy produces less effective government. It is, of course, true that non-democratic rulers do not have to bother about deliberation in assemblies or worry about majorities and public opinion. So, they can be very quick and efficient in decision making and implementation. Democracy is based on the idea of deliberation and negotiation. So, some delay is bound to take place. Does that make democratic government ineffi cient?\n\nLet us think in terms of costs. Imagine a government that may take decisions very fast. But it may take decisions that are not accepted by the people and may therefore face problems. In contrast, the democratic government will take more time to follow procedures before arriving at a decision. But because it has followed procedures, its decisions may be both more acceptable to the people and more effective. So, the cost of time that democracy pays is perhaps worth it.\n\n![](images/14fd6071a5487176b93405ed7deec8590fee13b7718609b683c133ed3af92a9f.jpg)\n\nNow look at the other side \u2013 democracy ensures that decision making will be based on norms and procedures. So, a citizen who wants to know if a decision was taken through the correct procedures can fi nd this out. She has the right and the means to examine the process of decision making. This is known as transparency. This factor is often missing from a non-democratic government. Therefore, when we are trying to fi nd out the outcomes of democracy, it is right to expect democracy to produce a government that follows procedures and is accountable to the people. We can also expect that the democratic government develops mechanisms for citizens to hold the government accountable and mechanisms for citizens to take part in decision making whenever they think fi t.\n\nIf you wanted to measure democracies on the basis of this expected outcome, you would look for the following practices and institutions: regular, free and fair elections; open public debate on\n\nCan you think of what and how the government knows about you and your family (for example ration cards and voter identity cards)?

The actual performance of democracies shows a mixed record on this. Democracies have had greater success in setting up regular and free elections and in setting up conditions for open public debate. But most democracies fall short of elections that provide a fair chance to everyone and in subjecting every decision to public debate. Democratic governments do not have a very good record when it comes to sharing information with citizens. All one can say in favour of democratic regimes is that they are much better than any n o n - d e m o c r a t i c r e g i m e i n these respects.\n\nIn substantive terms, it may be reasonable to expect from democracy a government that is attentive to the needs and demands of the people and is largely free of corruption. The record of democracies is not impressive on these two counts. Democracies often frustrate the needs of the people and often ignore\n\nthe demands of a majority of its population. The routine tales of corruption are enough to convince us that democracy is not free of this evil. At the same time, there is nothing to show that non-democracies are less corrupt or more sensitive to the people.\n\nThere is one respect in which democratic government is certainly better than its alternatives: democratic government is legitimate government. It may be slow, less efficient, not always very responsive or clean. But a democratic government is people\u2019s own government.

It will be a fair expectation that democracy should produce a harmonious social life. We have seen in the earlier chapters how democracies accommodate various social divisions. We saw in the fi rst chapter how Belgium has successfully negotiated differences among ethnic populations. Democracies usually develop a procedure to conduct their competition. This reduces the possibility of these tensions becoming explosive or violent.\n\nNo society can fully and permanently resolve confl icts among different groups. But we can certainly learn to respect these differences and we can also evolve mechanisms to negotiate the differences. Democracy is best suited to produce this outcome. Non-democratic regimes\n\noften turn a blind eye to or suppress internal social differences. Ability to handle social differences, divisions and confl icts is thus a defi nite plus point of democratic regimes. But the example of Sri Lanka reminds us that a democracy must fulfi l two conditions in order to achieve this outcome:\n\nIt is necessary to understand that democracy is not simply rule by majority opinion. The majority always needs to work with the minority so that governments function to represent the general view. Majority and minority opinions are not permanent.   \n\uf06c It is also necessary that rule by majority does not become rule by majority community in terms of religion or race or linguistic group, etc. Rule by majority means that in case of every decision or in case of\n\nAll you are saying is that democracy ensures that people do not break each other\u2019s head.

Democracy remains democracy only as long as every citizen has a chance of being in majority at some point\n\nof time. If someone is barred from being in majority on the basis of birth, then the democratic rule ceases to be accommodative for that person or group.\n\n![](images/c70703e815e4e2519485a675bdf41bcf4ed309d503c2212317d5749114f7e630.jpg)\n\n![](images/2da5b3d894b6ea52e719cb14c629cf1b2c58a871bc43ecfec18dbf6fdc43463d.jpg)  \nThe two images depict two different kinds of effects democratic politics can have on social divisions.

{"instruction": "Summarize the key information regarding Dignity and freedom of the citizens.", "context": "Democracy stands much superior to any other form of government in promoting dignity and freedom of the individual. Every individual wants to receive respect from fellow beings. Often confl icts arise among individuals because some feel that they are not treated with due respect. The passion for respect and freedom are the basis of democracy. Democracies throughout the world have recognised this, at least in principle. This has been achieved\n\nin various degrees in various democracies. For societies which have been built for long on the basis of subordination and domination, it is not a simple matter to recognise that all individuals are equal.\n\nTake the case of dignity of women. Most societies across the world were historically male dominated societies. Long struggles by women have created some sensitivity today that respect to and equal treatment of women are\n\nI am anxious about my board exams. But democracy has so many exams. And millions of examiners!\n\n![](images/3a8d1c71319738e955c6761762a1834222c8e433d25ccb61691d5af379d5fff3.jpg)\n\nnecessary ingredients of a democratic society. That does not mean that women are actually always treated with respect. But once the principle is recognised, it becomes easier for women to wage a struggle against what is now unacceptable legally and morally. In a non-democratic set up, this unacceptability would not have legal basis because the principle of individual freedom and dignity would not have the legal and moral force there. The same is true of caste inequalities. Democracy in India has strengthened the claims of the disadvantaged and discriminated castes for equal status and equal opportunity. There are instances still of caste-based inequalities and atrocities, but these lack the moral and legal foundations. Perhaps, it is the recognition that makes ordinary citizens value their democratic rights.\n\nExpectations from democracy also function as the criteria for judging any democratic country.\n\nWhat is most distinctive about democracy is that its examination never gets over. As democracy passes one test, it produces another test. As people get some benefi ts of democracy, they ask for more and want to make democracy even better. That is why, when we ask people about the way democracy functions, they will always come up with more expectations, and many complaints. The fact that people are complaining is itself a testimony to the success of democracy: it shows that people have developed awareness and the ability to expect and to look critically at power holders and the high and the mighty. A public expression of dissatisfaction with democracy shows the success of the democratic project: it transforms people from the status of a subject into that of a citizen. Most individuals today believe that their vote makes a difference to the way the government is run and to their own self-interest.\n\n![](images/3e8b838f04a62f24a9ce6f709639fee40d08ba31020e3461753f9f6dcf9d882f.jpg)  \nRosa Parks Still Inspires\n\nBelief in the effi cacy of vote is placed above the calculus of utility   \n![](images/e35f5b08b3a3f0592f2ba4357e6669fe6d4a122cdb2c60a74fda0ab73cbea1a6.jpg)  \nThe above cartoon and graph illustrate a point made in this section (Dignity and freedom of the citizens).
